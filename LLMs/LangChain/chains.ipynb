    "As for the pink one, it withstood a few drops, but after the most recent one, it no longer charges. The battery life on this tablet was really poor the last few months also, and it was never as good as the other one. The other tablet appears to be the same other than color, but the software had minor differences as well. I didn't think much of the differences originally, but seeing as this one degraded significantly in under a year and is now no longer usable and the other has had no apparent change in function with a comparable level of use and abuse definitely says something. Unfortunately, I would expect any future purchases to compare to the pink one, not the orange one.\n",

       "'Black body radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body, an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. The radiation is characterized by a continuous spectrum of frequencies, which is determined by the temperature of the black body.\\n\\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law is a physical law that states that the total energy radiated per unit area of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. This law is named after Josef Stefan and Ludwig Boltzmann, who first derived it in the late 19th century.\\n\\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law can be derived from the Planck radiation law, which describes the spectral distribution of black body radiation. The Planck radiation law states that the intensity of black body radiation at a given frequency is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and to the reciprocal of the wavelength squared.\\n\\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law is a very important law in physics, and it has many applications in astronomy, astrophysics, and thermodynamics. For example, the Stefan-Boltzmann law can be used to calculate the temperature of stars, planets, and other astronomical objects. It can also be used to calculate the rate of heat transfer between two objects.\\n\\nHere is a diagram that shows the relationship between black body radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\\n\\n[Diagram of black body radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law]\\n\\nThe diagram shows the spectral distribution of black body radiation at different temperatures. The intensity of the radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is the equation that relates the total energy radiated per unit area to the temperature of the black body.'"
