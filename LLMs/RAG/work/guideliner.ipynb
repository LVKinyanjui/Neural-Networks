Objects to annotate describe the general limitations of where a vehicle, pedestrian, and two-wheelers should be annotated. \\n\\n\\nVehicles, pedestrian and two-wheelers annotation starts with a table of all properties that makes up a vehicle, pedestrian or two-wheeler annotation and continues with subchapters further describing all properties. Nondescript vehicles, pedestrians and two-wheelers describe how to annotate vehicles, pedestrians and two-wheelers that are outside the regions where we want to annotate two-wheelers and some special cases. \\nKey Sections\\n* Summary of task\\n* Workflow\\n* When to annotate objects?\\n* Annotation Rules\\n* Table of labels \\n* Table of attributes\\n* Label Definitions\\nSummary of task\\n* Please create bounding boxes/cuboid for each object in the taxonomy across all frames. \\n* Each task will contain around 300 frames and each object should be tracked with a single ID.  \\n* Each bounding box should be drawn as tightly as possible to the object. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorkflow\\n Please take the following steps to avoid making errors and to ensure highest quality: \\n\\n\\n1. Scroll through the frames to familiarize yourself with the task, take note of areas that are congested with objects or have objects that are far away/hard to see.\\n\\n\\n2. Starting with the first frame, working in an order where the further objects are labeled first, select an object to label. \\n\\n\\n1. Draw the first label on the first frame, make sure the label is tight to the visible sections and assume the entire size of the object, if any portion of it is occluded.\\n\\n\\ni) If the object type, attributes or size of the object are initially unclear, scroll through the run segment to find the best view of the object. Use the visual information from the frame with the best view to estimate the objects’ size in frames the object is occluded.  \\n\\n\\n2. Continue to track and annotate that same object through all other frames the object has lidar dots or can be seen in the vision from the image - be sure to check all frames to be sure the object doesn’t disappear and reappear in another frame (it is very important that all objects are tracked with a single ID).\\n\\n\\n3. Returning back to the first frame, select another object and repeat step 2 for all visible objects.\\n4. Move to the next frame where an unlabeled object appears and repeat these steps. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen to annotate objects?\\n\\n\\nTwo things need to be considered when trying to annotate in this project:\\n\\n\\n* 1. Is it visible from the camera?\\n* 2. Does it have the minimum lidar points?\\nIf those 2 questions are YES, then ANNOTATE THE OBJECT!\\nIf there is not enough LiDAR data, but the object is visible in the camera, then ANNOTATE THE OBJECT!\\n\\n\\nExample 1:\\nIs it visible from the camera? Yes\\nDoes it have the minimum lidar points? Yes\\nCONCLUSION: ANNOTATE\\n\\n\\nExample 2:\\nIs it visible from the camera? Yes\\nDoes it have the minimum lidar points? No\\nCONCLUSION: ANNOTATE\\n\\n\\nExample 3:\\nIs it visible from the camera? No\\nDoes it have the minimum lidar points? No\\nCONCLUSION: DO NOT ANNOTATE\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\nReminder: DO NOT ANNOTATE objects behind the Ego Car\\nAll objects that are not visible in camera view SHOULD NOT be annotated, this means that all objects behind the ego car in frame 1 shall not be annotated.\\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnotation Rules\\nRule\\n\\tExample\\n\\tOcclusion / Truncation\\n\\tRemember that the occlusion level is now also determined by the edges of the camera and the hood of the egocar.\\n\\n\\nSo as the vehicle advances the occlusion changes constantly until the object is completely occluded. \\n\\n\\nYou need to change the value in occlusion in every frame where the parts of the ego car encounter with the object see example on the right\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tBounding box\\n\\tDraw the 3D Bounding Box as tightly as possible to the object. \\n\\n\\n* A box never changes size even if it is on a pedestrian and the pedestrian crouches.\\n\\t  \\n  \\n\\n\\tVEHICLE \\n\\tDistance and size conditions\\n\\n\\nVehicles which fulfill distance and size conditions for annotation shall be annotated as vehicle objects (see chart below).\\n\\n\\nVehicles which fulfill distance and size conditions for annotation as Nondescript shall be annotated as NonDescriptVehicle (see chart below).\\n\\n\\nVehicle objects are those objects which the driver, or driving system, must take into account when determining which actions to take while driving.\\n\\n\\nVehicles which do not fulfill the distance and size conditions for annotation as vehicles or Nondescript do not need to be annotated.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe distance and size conditions are summarized in the following.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tObject type\\n\\tDistance Pixel | height\\n\\tVehicle\\n\\n\\nCar\\nVan\\nSuv\\nKcar\\nAutoRickshaw\\nPickup\\nTrailer\\nOtherVehicle\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n<= 250m                                        >= 15 pixels\\n\\tTruck\\nBus\\nHeavyEquipmentVehicle\\nRoadWorkVehicle\\n\\t<= 250m                                       >= 34 pixels\\n\\tNondescriptVehicle\\n\\n\\nCar\\nVan\\nSuv\\nKcar\\nAutoRickshaw\\nPickup\\nTrailer\\nOtherVehicle\\n\\t> 250m and <= 350m                   >= 10 pixels and < 15 pixels\\n\\tTruck\\nBus\\nHeavyEquipmentVehicle\\nRoadWorkVehicle\\n\\t> 250m and <= 350m                 >= 24 pixels and < 34 pixels\\n\\tUnannotated Objects\\n\\n\\nCar\\nVan\\nSuv\\nKcar\\nAutoRickshaw\\nPickup\\nTrailer\\nOtherVehicle\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n> 350 m                                      < 10 pixels\\n\\tTruck\\nBus\\nHeavyEquipmentVehicle\\nRoadWorkVehicle\\n\\t> 350 m                                    < 24 pixels\\n\\tLocation Conditions\\n\\n\\nLocation conditions for vehicles at a distance up to 100 m:\\n\\n\\nFor vehicles located on the Ego Roadway:\\n* All vehicles on the Ego Roadway fulfill the location conditions, regardless of lane.\\n* Lanes that are separated by a physical barrier are not part of the Ego Roadway.\\n\\n\\nFor vehicles not located on the Ego Roadway:\\n* Vehicles on other roadways which intersect the Ego Roadway fulfill the location conditions. This includes vehicles on crossings and roundabouts.\\n* Vehicles on parking spaces on the side of the Ego Roadway fulfill the location conditions, even if the space the vehicle is parked in is not a legal parking space.\\n\\n\\nLocation conditions for vehicles at a distance over 100 m:\\n\\n\\nFor vehicles located on the Ego Roadway:\\n* Vehicles in the Ego Lane, Left Neigboring Lane and Right Neighboring Lane fulfill the location conditions.\\n* Only a part of the vehicle needs to be in one of the above mentioned lanes in order to fulfill the location conditions.\\n* Lanes that are separated by a physical barrier are not part of the Ego Roadway.\\n\\n\\nFor vehicles not located on the Ego Roadway:\\n* Vehicles on other roadways which intersect the Ego Roadway fulfill the location conditions. This includes vehicles on crossings and roundabouts.\\n* Vehicles on parking spaces on the side of the Ego Roadway fulfill the location conditions, even if the space the vehicle is parked in is not a legal parking space.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tOther conditions:\\n\\n\\n* The vehicle is an actual vehicle.\\n   * It is not a reflection, a picture, a statue etc.\\n* The vehicle is not covered by a tarpaulin.\\nThere are no conditions on vehicle movement. All relevant vehicles, whether they are moving, stopped or parked, shall be annotated.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tNondescriptVehicles\\n\\n\\nA vehicle or a group of vehicles shall be annotated as a NondescriptVehicle object if any of the following are true:\\n\\n\\n* The vehicle fulfills the pixel size or distance interval to be annotated as NondescriptVehicle described in Objects to be annotated, for example vehicles on the EgoRoad that are too far away to be considered as Vehicle annotation.\\n* The vehicle is driving on a road that is not part of the EgoRoad.\\n* The vehicle is driving on a lane that is separated from the EgoLane by a physical barrier.\\n* The vehicle is located on a parking lot or some other surface that is not part of the EgoRoad and does not have an impact on driving of the EgoVehicle.\\n* The vehicle is not an actual vehicle (e.g. reflections, statues and posters).\\n* The vehicle is covered by a tarpaulin.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe cuboid should cover the entire vehicle, but NOT including:\\n- Side mirrors\\n- Antennae\\n- Roof racks\\n- Open Trunk\\n- Open Doors\\n- Cargo\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tAny trailer or truck trailer that may have a different dynamic behavior than the vehicle it is attached to, shall always be annotated as a separate object of type Trailer. Trailers come in various shapes and sizes and the goal is to annotate the trailer without including unnecessary background\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tThe green object, annotated in the front, is a Truck, whilst the rear object(s) should be identified as Trailer(s)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tThe green object, annotated in the front, is a Truck, whilst the rear object(s) should be identified as Trailer(s)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tThe green object, annotated in the front, is a Car (or Van), whilst the rear object(s) should be identified as Trailer(s)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tIf it’s not possible to determine whether the object is a vehicle or a trailer, annotate it as a vehicle. In this example, annotate it as a Truck.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tIf you can determine the object is a trailer but never see the vehicle that is in the front of the trailer, then you do not need to annotate the vehicle.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tVan with trailer and vehicle as cargo.\\n\\n\\nSince the cargo is a vehicle, it should be annotated as a NondescriptVehicle object. Cargo should otherwise not be annotated\\nNote: For release validation, the cargo should not be annotated, even if the cargo is a vehicle.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tVehicles shall be annotated with 3D bounding boxes, based on available LiDAR measurements, in combination with vision based information from the image. If there is no LiDAR data, the 3D bounding box should still be annotated and the vehicle size and position in the world should be estimated according to the table below.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tTWO WHEELER\\n\\tAll two-wheelers within 413 meters of the ego vehicle that can be seen in the camera image shall be annotated, either as a Two Wheeler object, or a NondescriptTwoWheeler object. Fully occluded two-wheelers shall also be annotated in some cases – for details see TwoWheeler and NondescriptTwoWheeler.\\n\\n\\nNon-powered two-wheelers:\\n* Distance 0 - 160 m to be annotated as TwoWheeler or NondescriptTwoWheeler ( >=18 pixels )\\n* Distance 161 - 413 m to be annotated as  NondescriptTwoWheeler ( <18 , >10 pixels )\\n* Distance >413 m shall not be annotated (<10 pixels)\\nPowered two-wheelers:\\n* Distance 0 - 210 m to be annotated as TwoWheeler or NondescriptTwoWheeler ( >=13 pixels )\\n* Distance 211 - 413 m to be annotated as  NondescriptTwoWheeler ( <13 , >10 pixels )\\n* Distance >413 m shall not be annotated (<10 pixels)\\nAs a general rule: either both rider and two-wheeler are nondescript, or none of them are. That is, if either the rider or the two-wheeler fulfills the pixel criteria, both must be annotated.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIn order to make accurate annotations the usage of preceding and following frames is encouraged. This support is helpful for clarifying the content of confusing regions, which are still identifiable for the annotators.\\nHowever, if the object cannot be recognized in the current image with enough guarantees, even after using multiple frames, there shall be no annotation.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIn low visibility scenarios, such as during the night, the detection distance for many objects will be lower than during the day. Here it is important to use preceding and following frames with care as it is possible to “know” or predict where objects are despite not being at all visible in the current frame. Using one or two preceding/following frames might be okay but the object or attribute must still be discernible in the current frame.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tSome functions shall be co-annotated, meaning both functions are annotated in the same frames. For two-wheelers the following rules apply:\\n\\n\\nPedestrians and two-wheelers shall always be co-annotated. This means that a frame annotated according to this two-wheeler instruction shall also have been annotated according to the pedestrian instruction.\\nPedestrians, vehicles, two wheelers and animals shall be co-annotated when the AttachedTo property creates a connection between them in any way.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tA two-wheeler shall be annotated as a TwoWheeler object if, firstly, all of the following statements are true:\\n* The two-wheeler fulfills the appropriate distance criteria described in Objects To Be Annotated.\\n* The two-wheeler is an actual vehicle: not a reflection, statue, poster, etc.\\nSecondly, any of the following statements must be true:\\n* The two-wheeler has one or more riders.\\n* The two-wheeler is walked by a pedestrian.\\n* The two-wheeler is carried or pulled by a vehicle or two-wheeler.\\nAnnotate two-wheelers without riders NondescriptTwoWheelers.+\\nFinally, any of the following statements must be true:\\n* Any part of the two-wheeler can be seen in camera image.\\n* Any part of the two-wheeler’s rider(s) can be seen in the camera image.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tPEDESTRIAN\\n\\tAll people that are visible in the camera image shall be annotated as Pedestrians, if they are within the ranges specified below. This means\\nthat:\\n\\n\\n* If you cannot see the person in the camera image, you should not annotate them.\\n* If you cannot see the person in the LIDAR point cloud, you should annotate them anyway (if they can be seen in the camera image). The 3D bounding box shall be estimated.\\n\\n\\nIf a person is riding a TwoWheeler: If you can see either the TwoWheeler or the rider, then annotate both. If one of them is fully occluded, the annotations shall be estimated.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tEvery pedestrian described in this specification and observed in the image of the camera must be annotated according to Pedestrian Annotation or NondescriptPedestrian. Notably they also have to be annotated despite being fully occluded in some scenarios, see Co-annotation.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tThe measure to determine if an object should be ann vehicle and height in\\nPixels.\\nThe estimated sizes for pedestrians should be as follows in the subtitles in this square.\\n* Pedestrian 1.7m (adult) \\n   * Between 0 and 160 meters should be annotated with Pedestrian Annotation or NondescriptPedestrian (>=25 pixels).\\n   * Between 160 and 413  meters should be annotated with NondescriptPedestrian.

(>=19 pixels)\\n   * Between 160 and 413  meters should be annotated with NondescriptPedestrian.

This also applies for things that are semi-transparent, for example a sparse fence or a freeway divider.\\n\\n\\nIn general, weather conditions do not cause occlusion, e.g., heavy rain or fog does not cause blockage if it only limits the distance at which vehicles can be viewed clearly. However, if the weather condition causes direct blockage of the camera image, e.g., snow on the windshield, it can cause occlusion.\\n\\n\\nA vehicle is not considered occluded by another vehicle if only the bounding boxes are overlapping, and not the actual vehicles.\\n\\n\\nIf a vehicle is fully occluded and then reappears, the same ObjectId shall be assigned to the vehicle both times.\\n\\n\\nAn object that becomes fully occluded and can’t be seen in the subsequent frames, should be annotated for at least 5 more frames by roughly estimating its position.\\n\\n\\n* Since the object is fully occluded, the positioning of the bounding box is subject to vary between annotators. Therefore, the bounding box does not adhere to the same strict requirements as a fully visible object. However, it is still important that the position changes between frames similarly to how the object was moving when it was last seen.\\n\\n\\nIf an object has high occlusion (defined as ‘Occlusion90’ and ‘Fully’ in OcclusionsStatus), then only the 3D box, ObjectId and occlusion status are needed to be annotated.\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\tDefinition\\n\\tExample\\n\\tCAR\\n90\\n\\n\\nCAR\\nNone\\n\\n\\n\\tThe vehicle is heavily occluded, but parts of it can still be seen.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tTruck\\n40\\n\\n\\nCAR\\nNone\\n\\n\\n\\tVehicle (truck) occluded by another vehicle (car)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tBus\\nNone\\n\\n\\nCAR\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\tVehicle (car) occluded by multiple objects.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tTruck\\nNone\\n\\n\\nTruck\\n80\\n\\n\\n\\tThe mirror of Id1 is occluding Id2\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nLaneAssignment\\n\\n\\nThe order and the type of the lane that the Vehicle is driving in.\\n\\n\\nEach Vehicle should be assigned to a lane. The Vehicle is considered to occupy a lane if at least half of the Vehicle is on the lane. If the ego vehicle changes lane, the LaneAssignment of all Vehicles in the frame changes when the front center of the ego vehicle crosses the lane marking.\\n\\n\\nIf a Vehicle is precisely on the border of two lanes it should be assigned to the lane closest to the ego vehicle. If the proper choice for LaneAssignment is indeterminate, LaneAssignment shall be set to Unknown.\\n\\n\\nThe LaneAssignment property defines in which lane an annotated vehicle is driving on, relative to ego lane.\\nThis is capped at 2 lanes, a car that is 3 lanes to the left is still FurtherLeft and a car that is 3 lanes to the right is FurtherRight. Requirements: \\n\\n\\nLaneAssignment is only relevant for all the cases where the lane assignment is applicable, it is e.g. not applicable for vehicles in parking lots. If a vehicle is perpendicular to the road the ego vehicle is driving on, for example in crossroads, it should be assigned to the lane from ego vehicle’s road that it directly intersects with.  Example: if the perpendicular vehicle is crossing the ego lane in front of the ego vehicle, it should be assigned to the EgoLane. If the perpendicular vehicle is not directly crossing any of the lanes of the road the ego vehicle is driving on, laneAssignment will be set to Unknown.  \\n\\n\\nThe vehicle is considered to be lane changed when crossing the lane marking with the center of the front or rear side.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaneAssignment\\n\\tDefinition\\n\\tExample\\n\\tUnknown\\n\\tUnknown should be set if the lane markings are not visible on the road.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tUnknown\\n\\tThe truck on the left is on another road and should be set as Unknown\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf any of the following conditions are true, set LaneAssignment to Unknown:\\n\\n\\n* Perpendicular vehicles in a cross road that are not directly intersecting lanes of the road the ego  vehicle is driving on\\n\\n\\n* Parking lots\\n\\n\\n* Vehicles separated by a restricted area.\\n\\n\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nActiveLights\\n\\n\\nThe traffic signaling lights of the vehicle.\\n\\n\\n* Annotate lights for vehicles further away than 100 m as OutOfRange, regardless of status.\\n* Annotate lights for vehicles with LaneAssignment FurtherLeft or FurtherRight as OutOfRange, regardless of status.\\n\\n\\nSee the following sections for more detailed instructions for each active light for vehicles in range.\\n  \\n\\nType\\n\\tDefinition\\n\\tExample\\n\\tBrake\\n\\tWhen the brake lights are visible and lit (emitting light), annotate Brake as On\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the brake lights are visible and not lit (not emitting light), annotate Brake as Off\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tIn this example, only the tail lights are emitting light, not the brake lights.\\n\\n\\nWhen the lights are visible, but it is not possible to determine if the brake lights are lit or not, annotate Brake as Unknown\\n\\n\\nWhen the brake lights are not visible due to occlusion, annotate Brake as Occluded. In the cases of partial occlusion of some of the lights, where the status of the brake lights can still be clearly determined, Brake should not be annotated as Occluded.\\n\\n\\nWhen the brake lights do not exist, annotate Brake as NotApplicable\\n\\n\\nRequirements and Clarifications for Brakes:\\nThe brake lights can, if the vehicle is braking hard, blink similar to a turn indicator, but with higher frequency. If both brake lights are blinking, in combination with the center brake light, annotate Brake as IntervalOn.\\n\\n\\nThe left and right brake lights can, in some countries (e.g. USA), be combined with turn lights and tail lights. The center brake light is often used to resolve ambiguity.\\n\\n\\nIf the brake light and tail light is shared, the brake light is usually more intense when active, along with an active center brake light, only then should\\nBrake be annotated as On.\\n\\n\\nIf the brake light is used as a turn indicator, only one of the lights will blink and the center brake light will not be active. In these cases, annotate Brake\\nas Off.\\n\\n\\nIf the brake light is used as a turn indicator and the vehicle is braking, one of the lights will blink whilst the other has a solid intense light. In these cases,\\nannotate Brake as On.\\n\\n\\nFor RoadWorkVehicle objects, ensure that warning lights are not annotated as brake lights.\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tTurnLeft\\n\\tThe left turn light is located on the left side of the annotated vehicle, relative to the vehicle itself.\\n\\n\\nAnnotate TurnLeft as On on the first frame that the left turn light turns on. If the turn light blinks multiple times, it’s not necessary to annotate TurnLeft as On every time it turns on, but only on the first blink.\\n\\n\\nAnnotate TurnLeft as Off on the first frame that the left turn light turns off and stops blinking. If the turn light blinks multiple times, it’s not necessary to annotate TurnLeft as Off every time it turns off, but only when it turns off and stays off.\\n\\n\\nIn all other frames in between when the left turn lights are visible and their status can be determined, annotate TurnLeft as IntervalOn, regardless of if the lights are on or off.\\n\\n\\nIn all other frames when lights are off, outside active interval, annotate them as Off.\\n\\n\\nIt is only necessary to explicitly annotate the first time the turn lights turn on and the last time they turn off because it is only necessary to mark the interval during which the turn lights are active.\\n\\n\\nIt’s possible that a driver turns off a turn light, then turns it on again, creating two subsequent turn light intervals. These should be marked separately, if possible. Go frame by frame to count how long a turn light stays on and off during an interval.\\n\\n\\nWhen the left turn light is visible, but it is not possible to determine if it is lit or not, annotate TurnLeft as Unknown\\n\\n\\nWhen the left turn light is not visible due to occlusion, annotate TurnLeft as Occluded\\n\\n\\nWhen the left turn light does not exist, annotate TurnLeft as NotApplicable\\n\\n\\nRequirements and Clarifications for TurnLeft\\nIn case of active hazard lights, annotate left and right turn lights as On.\\n\\n\\nRegional deviations (i.e. North America)\\n\\n\\nTurn lights can be red, not only orange.\\n\\n\\nThe brake lights might be used as turn lights instead of dedicated turn lights.\\n\\n\\nIf a vehicle is braking hard, the brake lights might have a high frequent blink, combined with an active center light.

The box contains the entire TwoWheeler, and is otherwise as small as possible. The rider(s) of the TwoWheeler shall not be taken into account when drawing the bounding box, and neither shall large objects carried by the TwoWheeler (see ProtrudingSides). Side-view mirrors and windshields shall also not be taken into account.\\nThe BoundingBox3D shall be placed and oriented such that the top, left and front of the box correspond to the top, left and front of the two-wheeler. The front direction of a TwoWheeler is defined as the direction that the TwoWheeler’s frame is primarily designed to move in.\\n\\n\\n      \\nNote: The images above are only added for the sake of illustration. BoundingBox3D is an object in the world, not the image. The 3D box does not include the protruding topbox.\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nOcclusion\\nThe OcclusionLevel describes, in percentage (%), approximately how much of the annotated TwoWheeler is occluded.\\n\\n\\nNote that this property only describes the occlusion of the actual TwoWheeler – occlusion that only affects the rider(s) shall not be considered.

In these cases, the TwoWheeler’s AttachedTo property shall be set to the ObjectId and type of the other object. A TwoWheeler can be AttachedTo several objects. The AttachedTo property is bidirectional, so if a TwoWheeler is AttachedTo an object, the object shall also be annotated as AttachedTo the TwoWheeler. Some examples are:\\nType\\n\\tDefinition\\n\\tExample\\n\\t\\n\\n\\tA trailer being pulled by a bicycle.

Because of this, the emergency lights of a TwoWheeler are annotated as a list of EmergencyLight objects. Each such object has a State and a Color. The list shall contain one object per unique color exhibited by the emergency lights throughout the recording – for example, if a Police TwoWheeler has two sets of blue lights and one set of red lights, then EmergencyLights shall contain two objects: one for the blue lights, and one for the red light.\\n\\n\\nThe State of an EmergencyLight object is described by the following Enum:\\nType\\n\\tDefinition\\n\\t  On\\n\\t(The light is active and lit in the current frame)\\n\\t  Off\\n\\t(The light is not active)\\n\\tIntervalOn\\n\\t(The light is active but not lit)\\n\\tOccluded\\n\\t(The light is not visible due to occlusion)\\n\\tUnknown\\n\\t(The light is visible but it cannot be determined if it’s on or off)\\n\\tNotApplicable\\n\\t(The light is not visible or doesn’t exist)\\n\\t\\n\\nNote: Surrounding frames need to be analyzed in order to separate between the Off and ActiveOff states.\\n\\n\\nThe color of an EmergencyLight object is described by the following Enum:\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nExample annotations:\\nType\\n\\tExample\\n\\tActiveOn, Blue\\nActiveOff, Orange\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tActiveOff, Blue\\nActiveOn, Orange\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tActiveOn, Blue\\nActiveOn, Orange\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLane\\n\\n\\nThe order and the type of the lane that the TwoWheeler is driving in.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nRemember to annotate the correct lane assignment according to the type of lane and the position of the object.\\n\\n\\nEach TwoWheeler should be assigned to a lane. The TwoWheeler is considered to occupy a lane if at least half of the TwoWheeler is on the lane. If the ego vehicle changes lane, the LaneAssignment of all TwoWheelers in the frame changes when the front center of the ego vehicle crosses the lane marking.\\n\\n\\nIf a TwoWheeler is precisely on the border of two lanes it should be assigned to the lane closest to the ego vehicle. If the proper choice for LaneAssignment is indeterminate, LaneAssignment shall be set to Unknown.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\tExample\\n\\tEgoLane\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tFirstLeft\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tFirstRight\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tFurtherLeft\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tFurtherRight\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tUnknown\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nLaneType\\nCoupled with LaneAssignment for more complete information about the Lanes.

Past or future frames shall not be used to derive the value.\\n\\n\\nProtrudingSide shall be annotated to Yes for a direction if the TwoWheeler is carrying cargo which protrudes from it by more than 20% of the bounding box’s extension. The direction is chosen based on the perspective of the TwoWheeler. This means that e.g. a bicycle with a protrusion on its left side will have ProtrudingSide Left set to Yes  regardless of whether the bicycle is oncoming or preceding.\\n\\n\\nThese are the options you will have.\\nType\\n\\tChoices\\n\\t  Left\\n\\tYes\\nNo\\nUnkown\\n\\tRight\\n\\tYes\\nNo\\nUnkown\\n\\tFront\\n\\tYes\\nNo\\nUnkown\\n\\tRear\\n\\tYes\\nNo\\nUnkown\\n\\tUp\\n\\tYes\\nNo\\nUnkown\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\tExample\\n\\tLeft: Yes, Right: Yes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tRear: Yes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tLeft: Yes, Right: Yes, Rear: Yes, Up:\\nYes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nHasBabySeat\\nBaby seats can be in different locations on a bike or a motorcycle: front, rear and even middle. This property is annotated for each frame independently. This means that HasBabySeat shall only be set to Yes if a baby seat is clearly visible in the current frame – if it is impossible to discern (due to e.g. distance or occlusion) whether or not a baby seat is attached to the TwoWheeler, HasBabySeat shall be set to Unknown. It also means that even if we know from frame T that the TwoWheeler has a baby seat, HasBabySeat shall still be set to Unknown in frameT +5 if it can no longer be clearly seen in that frame.\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\tExample\\n\\tYes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tNo\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHasCargoBox\\nHasCargoBox is set to Yes for TwoWheelers equipped with a cargo box, either intended for carrying children or general cargo. Cargo boxes are large and are typically build into the TwoWheeler’s frame – this means that e.g. bicycle baskets and typical scooter trunks are not considered to be cargo boxes for the purposes of this property. The cargo box itself may be open or covered by e.g. a lid, a textile tarp or a windowed roof.\\nThis property is annotated for each frame independently. This means that HasCargoBox shall only be set to Yes if a cargo box is clearly visible in the current frame – if it is impossible to discern (due to e.g. distance or occlusion) whether or not a cargo box is attached to the TwoWheeler, HasCargoBox shall be set to Unknown. It also means that even if we know from frame T that the TwoWheeler has a cargo box, HasCargoBox shall still be set to Unknown in frame T+5 if it can no longer be clearly seen in that frame.\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\tExample\\n\\tYes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tYes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tYes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tNo\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tNo\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThis property shall be set independently for each frame.

Delivery boxes come in different colors and sizes, but are larger than the small loading cases typically attached on the rear of\\ne.g scooters or motorcycles. Note that HasDeliveryBox shall only be set to Yes if the box is attached to the TwoWheeler itself – delivery boxes that are worn as backpacks do not count.\\nThis property is annotated for each frame independently. This means that HasDeliveryBox shall only be set to Yes if a delivery box is clearly visible in the current frame – if it is impossible to discern (due to e.g. distance or occlusion) whether or not a delivery box is attached to the TwoWheeler, HasDeliveryBox shall be set to Unknown. It also means that even if we know from frame T that the TwoWheeler has a delivery box, HasDeliveryBox shall still be set to Unknown in frame T+5 if it can no longer be clearly seen in that frame.\\n\\n\\nType\\n\\tExample\\n\\tLeft TW = No,\\n\\n\\n Right TW = Yes (green box)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tYes (teal and yellow box)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tYes\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\tUnknown (occluded)\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\nNOTE: This property shall be set independently for each frame.

A TwoWheeler is considered to be cutting while any part of it is crossing the lane separator marking.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe CutInOut property is only of interest for TwoWheelers that are either on the ego lane, or on directly neighboring lanes: in other words, TwoWheelers whoseL aneAssignment is either EgoLane, FirstLeft or\\nFirstRight.
