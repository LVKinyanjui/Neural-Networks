"Chaos is a ladder.

~ Tim (well, Baelish)"
Where did the raintrack at the end come from lol i want to listen to it for bedtime
How bad did women have it in 1950's?  They didn't have abortion handy?  They didn't have to work two jobs and raise their children by themselves?  They couldn't divorce and take the children and half the man's earnings and move to the next guy?  Tell us please how hard the woman of the 1950's had it.
i love this lefty content on great political theory
"The problem is that Democracy doesnt work on a scale as big as a country. It worked for Athens and the greek City-States because everyone in the city who was legally allowed to vote would go to the place where they could meet up and vote on stuff that affected them.

Rome had to be a Representative Republic because it had so many people over a large territory that it was physically impossible for everyone to be there, so places within the empire would send elected representatives in the hopes of affecting changes that would make their lives better.

Even the founding fathers for america wanted there to be more than two political parties because they knew if it came down to things like democrat vs republican or liberal vs conservative, it wpuld tear the country in two... which it nearly did when Lincoln was in power.

The problem comes from the fact that we don't have a system as humans that will ease our lives across the board. If you go to ANY country in the world and ask to see where the working class people that make up the bulk of the labor force in a country lives... you'll be directed to the worst parts of cities. But if we were to simply take the socialist way out, that would fail as well because throughout history its been shown that people aren't as motivated towards success if they are given exactly the same as their neighbor if they believed they worked harder than their neighbor.

Hell, we don't even have a good reason why inflation happens. The sheer fact that $100 in the beginning of our country had close to the same buying power as $1000-4000 now means that despite the fact that capitalism has worked so far, its inevitably going to fail as the common person wont be able to afford necessities and the luxuries that depend on people having disposable income will fail just as quickly."
"My guy, please read a book on Marxist theory. Lenin did not want a LIBERAL democratic society, liberalism is the foundation of Capitalist Imperialism, something Lenin literally wrote about in books like State and the Revolution and Imperialism: The Highest Form of Capitalism. These notions that Lenin wanted to set up a liberal society but was betrayed by Stalin is nothing more than Red Scare anti-communist propaganda. Liberalism is the implementation of human rights, primarily the right to private property and individual freedoms, mainly the right to behave however you want in a free market. These are core principles of Capitalism. Liberal democracy (which isn't particularly democratic, mind you), is meant to provide consent to maintain this economic system, hence why every liberal government is run by capitalist political parties. Don't take my word for it, Lenin's writings on marxism and a whole host of other writings on Marxism are freely available online or there are plenty of videos that lay out what Lenin and other Marxists believed. Shaun, Contra Points, hbomberguy are just a few good sources to learn this stuff. 

Also when it comes to modern day Eastern Europe, the reason why many people, not just Russians, want a return to Communism is because their current living conditions are far worse than they ever were under the ""Authoritarian Communist Regimes"", who provided free housing, healthcare and guaranteed employment for all. Doesn't sound particularly Authoritarian to me. Eastern European countries are the fastest aging countries in the world, because of the undemocratic dissolution of the USSR and the authoritarian injection of Free Market Capitalism into each of the countries. Just because these former socialist nations utilised a form of government besides liberal democracy prior to the ""Shock Therapy"" they underwent, does not make them authoritarian dictatorships. There is far more nuace to the situations all these countries were in, plus years and years of anti-communist propaganda being drilled into everyones heads has painted a picture that these countries were real life versions of 1984. Please interrogate these concepts and don't take them at face value. Blackshirts and Reds by Michael Parenti is a good short read on the Anti-Communist myths and what life was really like under socialism. 

Plus when it comes to writing a story about a revolution, what better source is there than actual revolutionary Marxist literature. If you want your story to be as true to real life as possible, there is no better analysis of revolutions and what brings about revolution than Marxism. Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxembourg, Lenin, these were all pioneers of revolutionary thought and should be considered must reads, even if you disagree with Socialist thought, when writing about a revolution. Their ideas lay the foundation  for the rise of socialism all over the world through revolution and concepts like dialectical materialism and historical matieralism are great tools for fleshing out the conditions that would bring about a revolution."
"I wrote this almost a year ago after digging deeper into history of my birth-country. I think it fits here.
Identity crisis of a russian-born man. 
We're raised to European level standards of quality, rights, freedom of speech and belief, yet encounter a spiraling history of conflicts, bloodbaths, treason, militant groups all over the past century and present. Fighting those who were our allies, forfeiting treaties right after signing them, not even ceasing the fire in the middle of the talks, scamming entire nations — not to mention, our own people. Fake it till you make it.. we never did — only a handful of people, and yet those have the most blood-stained hands, shirts, and bills. 
The attempts at hegemony and control of the region and repeated collapses of it are comical when viewed from an outside perspective. You can't make a sweet treat out of poo — it may even look like one for a short while, but will never taste the same. 
 
The core issues are in how things are done, played even, inside the people, their principles. 
Lack of motivation, some say. We were born this way. Raised mostly, too. Accepting what's available and too scared to achieve more. Only anomalies are able to stand their way through such — and what for? 
The state is ""in shambles"", the potential heroes — killed or silenced. They don't see support from the people as the people have no more will. The people want to be Left Alone. 
It's no surprise that the only chance to survive is to remove themselves from the immediate threat, trying your best remotely, only keeping the exposure via a distanced one (it too, at times, being closer than one hopes for). That, however, eases further distancing from within and opens up new opportunities to silence the whole ordeal, spreading further lies.

Nobody can be trusted, they say. ""Truth is more complex than that.""
It's the winners who write the truth, but the tactics are outdated, so the state actually loses. But only so for those who actually seek the truth.
The commoner doesn't do it intentionally, there's no culture for it — instead, they try to keep up with enough to make somewhat of a guess out of the specially prepared food for thought, with spices and variety of just the right way to not be able to definitively say: ""This is the position, the flavor of this place and cuisine."" — instead, it's a mixture from all the sources available, a never-ending semi-improvised series where mishaps are common but forgotten, where the ingredients have rotten all the way down but have decently looking make up.. Sometimes, not even that.

Systemic and planned bullying, setting up nations against each other in an attempt to worsen the consequences of the inevitable. 
The further blindness to it lead to what was planned but forgotten. 
Next, you're turning onto your brother, your farther, your mother, as ""They don't understand. They're wrong, and need to be treated. Repaired. Fixed."", based on doctored claims that just so happen to align enough to make some resemblance of sense and then allow one to hypothesize their own findings. Oh so convenient, isn't it?

A hilarious comparison comes to mind, as nowadays it's almost like some want this people to feel like Israelites, in a way. The ""true inheriters"", the ""righteous"", ""with God on their side"". And yet the religion is contradicting itself in the most awful way, praising those who go into battle. Promising heaven. And this is mere dozens of years after eradication of the institution of church altogether, spreading ""scientific"" beliefs, an attempt to nurture at least some sense. It's obviously another tool, used when it fits. Though sometimes you use an axe to nail things as you don't have a hammer. One wonders — when the handle scatters in pieces, what will get cut off by it's falling head?

Everyone's at fault. And little to nobody blame themselves. Some do, but it won't reverse the action. A solution is necessary, yet nobody has one, apart from learning from the mistakes."
my dude talks about Stalin and shows a map of modern Russia 🙄
Actually Morsi was couped after only a year
"You ally with Goblin Kingdom, provide them access to raid other countries around Futurestan, in exchange have percentage from Gold and Gem mines in Goblin Kingdom. Use that money to create Swedish Syle Welfare state, have Goblin Kingdom train your army. Fortify like Switzerland. Success."
"I always point to Fidel Castro in Cuba. He was calling for elections from the start in response to the seizure of power before the scheduled 1952 national elections, but he moved towards ""elections later"" in a gradual process after actually seizing power. That eventually became genuine national elections never and you ended up with the 1976 constitution which furthered that arrangement."
"20:34 - ""All experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed."""
This video just made me apppreciate the United States of America even more
Well except for that time it created the most powerful military country
"I've said this many times to friends and I will say it here. The success of a revolution is not in the initial event where it occurs but in the ideas that it spawns. The French revolution for all intents and purposes was a failure initially. It led to a power vacuum where revolutionary groups fought bitterly for power. There were constant unrest, political terror, counter-revolution, continental war, and then return to autocracy. But the ideals the revolution espoused are ultimately what made the revolution a success in the long run. The principles of ""liberte, egalite, fraternite"" inspired the revolutions of 1848 and would ultimately be realized in France after Napoleon III.

The Arab Spring was a failure too but like the French one, it forever changed the course of the Arab world. The ideals of freedom and democracy that inspired the Tunisians, Egyptians, and Syrians will not be forgotten and will serve as a blueprint for the future of the region. We might not see it now but the Arab Spring already set the gears in motion for a better Arab world."
Loved the flash of  Paul Atreides  at the end
"The 1950s America certainly wasn't perfect, but it wasn't a terrible place/time for women."
"Excellent content, first time to your channel. I can't help but offer technical critiques: white balance and autofocus need some work. These are easy fixes; both can be done with your camera, and if that is an issue for me whatever reason, you can at least fix the white balance in your edit."
How do you protect your glorious revolution from the next one!?
"Related to this topic, I HIGHLY recommend a game called Not For Broadcast. Unlike most games you are neither a soldier fighting the revolution nor the ruler, instead you are a lowly broadcast engineer who gets the job by accident at the worst time when a new radical government takes power in a fictional country. The game has a lot of comedy but is also dead serious at other times. The twist is, that the government is actually left wing and they genuinely want to do good by their people."
"Was hoping to see the Overly Sarcastic Empires borders on the map, but I guess this map is dated to before the expansion 😅 also ""The Goblins Kingdom"" might look small but 80% of it is underground"
This is extremely helpful and well timed for me! I’m working on building a faction heavy warring kingdoms world right now and learning more about revolutions and dictatorship is super useful!! Thank you!!
"The difference between the revolution leaders and new leaders is something I wrote about in one of my settings. The leader was a great warrior, someone who was able to out maneuver the navy and storm the bastion and ""cut the head off the snake"".

They are popular and iconic, but they know they are a killer not a hero. They choose to step down, isolate their violence, focus the revolution on the political and humanitarian action of his second. Remind people of the removal of slavery and indentured servitude in the nation, rather than the slaughter of slave traders. The new social mobility provided by schools and education, rather than the fact some of the most famous guild leaders were executed.

It's not like I had them go totally away, but it was distinctly presented as they and their sorts were outsiders who were good at breaking stagnant corrupt systems, but others had to fix them."
The Committee of Public Safety would like a word citizen.
"""Terror without virtue is cruel"". ""Virtue without terror is impotent""."
"It doesn’t take much to kill a government 
But it takes much to build one"
"So many echo's of CGP Grey's ""Rules for rulers"" - I can't remember the name of the Book is based on"
"Mathew 7:16 -20

16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? 
17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 
18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 
19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
20 Therefore by their fruits you will know them."
Im just happy that the Dutcht of Dom is safe.  President Dom Mazzetti is a peace loving bro who just wants trade relations to continue.
"When you want to remove a current system, you must have system to replace it.
Not after everything is over, but at the exact same time.
(similar to how ""covid"" happend a distress occured, but the new system was nearly seemlesly being introduced as the distress occurred.)
Pretty different than war, but I think it is similar?
just started the video btw"
The Phoenix in the sword by Robert E Howard cover this very thing
"What I'm hearing, is that removing only one does not solve all corruption. If you want to remove a weed, pull it out by the roots."
Watching this as an American really makes me appreciate just how well the American revolution worked out all things considered.
"You forgot to mention France's (and other European countries') support for the American Revolution. Considering how much the U.S. selectively trots out that part of its history, I think it's pretty important to remind people just how big a role French resources paid.

The French didn't (single-handedly) win, let alone lead it, of course, but their support was key, let alone that their presence made the idea of continuing the war that much less appealing/feasible to the British. 

And as loathe as I am to acknowledge American influence on history, their Revolution had a massive impact on Europe, both because it elevated the lives/careers of people as notable as the Marquis de Lafayette and for the strain it put on France's state finances that helped precipitate the French Revolution. And remember, that's just the European history. Don't forget South America."
"Well, this an interesting view. Would like a view of societies that have navigated these dilemmas successfully."
"The funny part is

“Revolution” never fails.

Because if it failed, it will be just a “rebellion”."
"I think there needs to be more historical and material analysis. If a revolution appears to fall apart or betray its original supporters, it's because they haven't yet addressed the original material conditions which brought about the revolution -- or said another way: the revolution isn't actually over. If the working class rise up against the oppression by their overseers, then of course they will oppose ""revolutionaries"" who just take on the role as new masters. The conditions haven't changed. The revolution is still ongoing. 

Of special note is that the revolution belongs to the masses whose material conditions drive the revolution, not the revolutionaries or new regime itself. Thinking in terms of the rise and fall of political groups and figures is similar to Great Man theory, where history is seen as narratives of characters instead of material processes and events. This is also why I think it's not the best idea to use fictional stories as primary inspiration, only examples of how (in)accurate they are to real history."
"Brilliant video as ever! I've been reading a lot of contemporary sources on the Communist revolution in Russia, and it's interesting to see the continuity that was felt with the failed 1905 revolution, as well as how the February Revolution was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution. Then, how the Bolsheviks immediately found themselves up against those challenges of meeting their promises, faced with huge interference from the Entente powers in WW1 (backing the White army in the civil war), the German and Austrian aristocrats looking for major gains from the revolutionary promise to end the war, and the desperate need to rebuild and then supply an army that they could rely on. In amongst all of which (as mentioned in the video) factional disputes and Stalin's machinations were already shaping up.

I've wanted to write some kind of management sim video game about being a victorious leftwing revolutionary trying to keep a lid on all this, and many of the issues I've been thinking about how to frame in that way are covered. (A video game that does it from a more interactive novel kind of angle is Suzerain, which gives you options of which global/foreign powers to align with, as well as internal business leaders.)"
"Two tiny things I don't understand about Stalin: why was he reconducted to power the three times he renounced? And why after his death a revisionist like Krushev arised to power? And, another tiny thing: does Operation Paperclip might have molded our vision of USSR, as much as Radio Free Asia molded our vision of the Extreme Orient?"
"People want food and water? They want stability? A master can feed their slave, give them water, and provide a shelter. There you go: food, water, and relative safety. 

Maybe, instead, people want respect to their dignity (which require opportunities for food and water by virtue of the fact). Maybe they know that food and water can be used as leverage, and revolutions (peaceful or not) are a symptoms of the brokeness of humanity trying to shake off the lie that any system of government can promise, or cares to promise, the actual willing of their good."
"8:29 nah! Lenin was just as much of an tyrant as Stalin, he just did not have enough time to do as much as talin did, people need to stop giving him a free pass, I mean even though not publically enforcing Stalin, Lenin basically made it very easy for him to gain power, most likely seeing that Stalin was the man whom Lenin saw as the ideal successor, something which comes clear when one looks at the similarities in leadership styles between the two. Oh and it is quite inaccurate to say that Lenin of all people was pro democracy."
Than why did the people's power revolution worked in the Philippines
"As maybe the only person other than Martin who's ACTUALLY interested in Aragorn's tax policy, thank you, Tim. These videos are always amazing and inspiring and I thank you for what you do for the writing community."
stalin was good.
"20:12 you should ad the country you're from/ living in,, or people might get strange ideas"
"19:40
Liberal democracy is a Bourgeoisie Democracy. Of course, it's not good for the normal people."
"17:24 
It's the intersectionality of centralisation and democracy. Centralisation eases the process of governing. If done right Centralisation can boost democracy, but in Dictatorships it's just a deterrent to democracy. This is what we call in Marxist literature Democratic Centralism. It's a pretty useful concept. I suggest you look into it. Luna Oi(a vitanamese youtuber) has a good series about it."
"Ngl, I suggest you read communist books. Your videos are pretty f**king great even though you have the occasional slip ups cause of Anti-communist propaganda's elusiveness. It's like you're this close to greatness🤏. I applaud you for your insightful videos either way.

Btw, you're right about the great leap forward except for one thing. The famine wasn't man-made. Famines like it have been happening for a long time in China at that point and the supply chain disruption by the revolution made for a destructive chain reaction. It's not really man-made per se. It's human error meets ""natural"" disaster(it's not really natural it's just Colonial exploitation)."
"4:42
Stalin is not a dictator. Even the f**king CIA admitted this in an internal document(I'll happily provide it on Twitter if you want). Ffs, until when will this pure propaganda persist(just this piece of info. Your takes are kinda fire for someone who's not entirely political but the red scare was too good at propagandizing)?"
"You should probably also make about the full circle revolution. 

where it turns out that the revolutionaries are just as corrupt and bad as the government they previously overthrew."
I'm not sure if you're just making worldbuilding videos or dropping hints and preparing us for a real-life revolution... Either way I'm in.
Ok but why don't revolutions fail?
"Do you need to buy both world building books, or just the most recent?"
"A great taste of the complexity of revolutions. It's not a subject I want to tackle in my own writing, just because of the sheer level of complexity, but I did like how a previous video mentioned it can just be a sort of set piece or trope, depending on the tone and focus of the story. Thanks for using a variety of real life and fictional examples! That helps a lot!"
"Build your new and better nation under the noses of the tyrant. Let it fester and boil. Like weeds, love and community will choke out the perfectly cultivated nightshades of control. Violent force is only useful in defense. Conquering others leads to a new tyrany."
war heroes rarely make great politicians
"I would suggest that it's also a question of what people are used to.  If your experience governance is that of corruption and brutality, you're going to be less likely to notice when it comes back.  Why note when the sun raises?"
"this is the logical conclusion of someone whose understanding of revolution begins and ends in fantasy / YA novels 

if you're in the comments, please, please, please engage with actual revolutionary communities and what they say and not the broad disconnected ramblings of a liberal kiwi"
"Dang, this explanation made me think about the star wars sequel trilogy and the bit about people not seeing the new government doing enough makes me understand why there would still be a resistance group. At least for me anyway."
"Weird how stalin the one who actually fulfilled the promises of the October revolution is shown as the ""autocrat"" here 😂"
I keep forgetting that these videos are on writing.
"“In revolution there are only two sorts of men, those who cause them and those who profit by them.”

“Dans les révolutions, il y a deux sortes de gens : ceux qui les font et ceux qui en profitent.”

Napoleon Bonaparte (who would know)"
Alma Coin wanting to have a hunger games for the Capitol’s children when NO ONE from District 13 was ever forced to participate in the hunger games is hilarious
Revelations tend to violently bring out the worse aspects of the societies and regimes they over through that is why they are rarely ever fully successful
Almost like Revolutions Are Complicated?
"The Hunger Games did an excellent job of showing the problem with the Revenge ideologies that the revolutionary forces tend to have, and that revenge narrative has strong traction. 

But in that scenario especially, the actions constituting the revenge go completely against the idea of why the revolution happened in the first place.

Further thoughts in a reply comment."
"On of the struggles I've had lately, especially after watching some of these recent videos, is a feeling of displaced hopelessness in my ability to ever properly/compellingly write a lot of these topics. There are just so many factors to track even before you put characters into the story."
"I would say your synopsis of the October Revolution is pretty inaccurate in a lot of ways, and is a bit of an outlier in terms of revolutionary forces you discuss.

First, the October Revolution was never meant to have any semblance of 'liberalism', even if Lenin often did appear to support liberal-ish values. This was mostly cosmetic; Lenin and the Bolsheviks were ruthlessly pragmatic yet ideologically devout. Even the Soviets were mostly used as a prop; during the Civil War, they had already mostly become the tool of the Party rather than any form of independent centers of worker power. Perhaps most importantly, everything discussed so far happened before Lenin died or  Stalin had risen to predominance in the USSR.

Second, while it is true that Stalin used personal and ideological divisions within the Party to take singular power, he never subverted the revolution. Stalin was, like Lenin, a ruthlessly pragmatic person willing to do anything to further the revolution and his own personal power (two things he did not see as being in conflict, and eventually even saw as overlapping with one another). Communist Party archives show the conversations Stalin had in private, framing significant proportions of Soviet policy around Marxist-Leninist principles, even if there had to be pragmatic concessions. The best example of this I could see would be the collectivization of agriculture. From a non-ML perspective, it was insanity; Stalin decided to replace the entire economic, political, and social system of the vast Russian peasantry DESPITE the fact the status quo was perfectly stable and viable. Even from within the party, Stalin faced opposition from Communists who believed it was far too early and far too dangerous to enforce a collective form of agriculture onto Russia. It was only Stalin's adherence to Marxist principles (namely, that the base determines the superstructure, meaning that if capitalism was not eradicated in the countryside then a socialist/communist government would eventually be destroyed) that made him see the collectivization of agriculture as a necessary risk."
"Gee wizz, it's almost like capitalism is actually the end boss 😉"
"For so long I've considered it the greatest failing of the Star Wars sequel trilogy that they didn't at all meaningfully play with the realities of how people can fall prey to glorifying terrible institutions that are no longer around, and the myriad of things that can come with or from that.

It's practically baked into the lore, and yet they didn't convey at all that the dread of seeing all that unrest and desperate clinging to and nostalgic pining for imperial ""stability"" could have been such a massive factor in wearing down even a beacon of a man like Luke Skywalker. But of course they didn't explain it, and I don't know if they even realized it, considering how on the nose the movies were in so many other ways.

The original and as much as I can't stand them even the prequel trilogies have so much relevance, and it seems like the sequels had moments of trying to be more, but they just ended up just being entertaining but wasteful, irrelevant light shows that didn't really illuminate anything about culture, myth, heroism or anything I can think of. At least not in a way that doesn't later or immediately implode in on itself."
"As with the other parts of this series, I again think such gross oversimplifications are detrimental to the goal of explaining something with such complex dynamics as a ""revolution"". Firstly, every revolution is different. Most of them fundamentally. You can't just say, ""This is how they all work."" Secondly, the revolutions of the Arab Spring are very bad examples. It's not a revolution in the first place if it's mainly or even entirely carried by the military establishment, as some of those were. But even if not, thirdly, a revolution that is not at all based on even remotely consensual ideological grounds is guaranteed to fail. It was clear as day those movements weren't sustainable. 

I don't think this is good information for people new to world building who want to write about revolutions. It only leads to the same, old oversimplified, boring tales. There are so many more interesting subjects to look at: if you want something dystopian, look at Lenin or Mao or even the French Revolution of 1789 that all eventually, ""ate their children."" If you want something tragic, look at the Parisian Commune or the German Revolution of 1848 who got crushed by the establishment for different reasons. If you want something utopian, take the peaceful revolution of 1989 in the GDR and transplant it onto another scenario, or look at how Marx and Engels themselves talk about their ideas for an actual, ideal Communist revolution that leads to the freed, classless society and make it happen, or invent whatever problems.

Those recent examples are just bad. There was no common ideological ground to build a new society on. People just wanted to ""get rid of the oppressor"", which in itself doesn't carry any revolutionary potential. Had you read any of the revolutionary theory you're claiming to talk about in your thumbnail, you would've known.

Edit 2: I do agree somewhat with the part about implementation. But what you kind of ignore but what I think is the core of the problem is that all those failed examples you named and didn't name have in common - none of them were revolutionary anymore at the point of those ""wrong turns"". Mao already was a dictator when he started the Great Leap Forward. Stalin already was a dictator when he started the Great Purge. The problem at this point is authoritarianism. You cannot rebuild (not ""reorganize"", btw) all of society from the top down. It needs to be a long, painful, but first and foremost _collective_ process."
"A lot of the scenarios mentioned could be avoided via anarchist methods of organisation. Hell, past societies worked pretty well on an internal basis, and only collapsed because of external invasion by states (Free Territory and Kronstadt taken over by the Soviets, Catalonia by Fascist Spain, Korean anarchist enclaves by the Japanese and Rojava currently facing incursions from Turkey). That sounds like a condemnation of anarchism, but all it really proves is that the point it raises about the state and unjust hierarchies are pretty much spot on (also something I'm planning to explore in my book series)."
"Alright next I wanna know *how revolutions succeed*
..for non suspicious reasons"
"These videos are very interesting.  I live in what is probably the oldest revolutionary government, in continued existence.  Even though it was not originally as democratic as it has become, the revolution had majority support, with local governments that were proto-democratic.  After the Revolution, the provisional government proposed the constitution that still exists [though much amended] and with a government elected under it, without interruption, since 1780.  The government and constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are older than those of the United States.

It has been argued that our revolutions weren't real revolutions like the French one.  I reply by detailing the events at Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill.  They claim that there was no dramatic social change, and I reply by stating that the population at large overthrew a monarchy and established a democratic republic.  Here ""power to the people"" actually worked as the people abolished the non democratic government and have kept, and expanded their rights.  We have never had a military government or a dictator."
Don’t wanna listen to a socialist try and say why it failed
One thing that always kind of annoyed me is that historically we tend to remember revolutions for what came of them rather than what caused them. Comfortable people dont go to war over ideology.
"Love how small the Goblin Kingdom is on the map in the beginning.  Take that, ya disheveled bastard!  :-P"
"Piss poor doesn't mean really poor in money terms, it means poor as in bad"
"It’s a shame this guy won’t re-examine his interpretation of socialist leaders. 18:05 could I be wrong and clinging to the ideology of perfection? No, it’s the socialists who are idealists!"
"That bit about idealizing the past really hit home. In Portugal it´s still common to see older people idealizing Salazar´s regime as a time of order and stability, when the government wasn´t corrupt and was efficient, as opposed to today. Hell , even young people grow up hearing this kind of crap and they also come to idealize or respect the figure of Salazar as an efficient leader, despite being able to search on the internet the data that contradicts all the points mentioned above. 
Really sad to see near-fascism (or just straight up fascism) resing up again in my country, supported not only but the old, but the young too."
One of the very VERY few honest treatises on revolutions. Should be mandatory material to all would-be revolutionaries.
"These political reviews have been excellent, thank you for doing all this research!"
"there's an aspect you've apparently overlooked. i say apparently bc i'm done. i came here for leftist content not more writing advice. frequently the majority of structures in society rely on the government so taking down the government knocks down everything else. scared people demand law and order and the fascists or theocracy take over. that's why we must build first, else we just hand it to the fascists, which is a moot point, as the fascists are the only faction likely to organize and sustain a revolt against the neoliberal establishment right now anyway. seeing a third option is my specialty, i hope. we must build, build something outside the system and guard against its being co-opted, so if the system falls, we need not all fall with it. also there's a difference between property crime and violence"
"Anyone interested in this should also check out critical geopolitics, which is the study of how this is all presented through various assumptions of the western gaze."
"I’m surprised you went through this whole thing without referencing Brent Weeks’ Lightbringer saga which explores these very ideas in TWO different revolutions, one with Dazen Guile, and one with the Color Prince."
"I really wish the creatives at Disney Star Wars had employed people with actual writing skills/knowledge like this for the Sequel Trilogy.

Rebels, Rogue One, and Andor lay the groundwork for what's explained here, expanding on all the different factions that made up the Rebellion.  Mon Mothma's & Bail Organa's disillusioned senators, vs Saw Gerrera's whatever it takes gorilla fighters, vs the industrial interests of worlds like Corellia & the Mon Calamari, etc.  These groups have vastly different goals, power bases, and obligations.

Even the remnants of the Empire are a much more dynamic and interesting, as shown in Battlefront 2 campaign and with Mayfeld in Mandalorian.  Providing even more opportunities for great story telling.

"Something you really have to remember is that with outlandishly rare exceptions, the dictator isnt overthrown unless the military ALLOWS the dictator to be overthrown.

The peasants storming the palace is a nice trope, but a mob of unarmed or melee armed peasants loses to a handful of well-fed palace guards with machine guns 10 times out of 10. Which is whybwith every irl revolution mentioned, the leader is only deposed once the generals join the revolutionaries and the soldiers either lay down their weapons or actuvely join the mob."

It's also easy to look back fondly on the USSR when they made sure you had housing and energy and education and a job and equal rights for women and didn't come with all the problems of capitalism and nationalism that Putin offers.
Haiti is probably the worst case scenario for a revolution.
Suggesting Stalin had autocratic power is very incorrect. Look into the democratic structures of the Soviet Union. The Premier had no power without the lower representatives voting a thing in and Stalin even tried to resign 3 different times but was prevented from doing so every time.

"makes me think just how lucky the American revolution was after winning the war of independence.  Like other revolutions that have been covered, the thirteen colonies were on the brink of chaos and civil war, the continental army ready to mount a coup over not getting paid for their services, local revolts over farmers falling into debt funding or fighting for the revolution. It was by good fortune that the most respected and influential figures of the time held true to their idea of building a republic. Especially men like Washington who could have very easily used his celebrity status to install himself as a dictator but playing the role of an elderly gentleman, he did what thought he needed to do to build a foundation and once he found capable hands to pass off responsibility to, he retired at his first chance."
I don't care how you show the niger military. Like France has done horrible things to those countries up until they choose to take back there countries.

"4:30 You seem to be suggesting that Stalin betrayed the revolution and betrayed Lenin, which is simplistic. Lenin was a ruthless fanatic who was himself targeted for assassination by other left-wing radicals after he ignored the results of Russia's first democratic elections (his party didn't win it) and after he ceded huge swathes of territory to the German Kaiserreich (which fed widespread paranoia that he was actually a German spy). 

Almost all of Stalin's private correspondence paints him as a fervent believer in Marxist-Leninism, just one who distrusted anybody else to implement it properly and feared his own comrades becoming lazy, soft and weak without regular purges and injections of revolutionary fervour. Even Trotsky, living in exile and marked for death while his old allies were being marginalised or killed, sometimes spoke in defence of Stalin's policies and felt that Stalinist Russia was, while a degenerated worker's state, still superior to every single capitalist society on Earth.  

The line between a pragmatic ideologue and a cynical, power-hungry opportunist can be a blurry one. Neither Lenin nor Trotsky were supporters of any sort of liberal democracy- considered a decadent, bourgeoise conceit-; they, like Stalin, believed that a brutal dictatorship was true democracy if it was dedicated to installing Socialism in the name of the working classes. For Stalin, establishing himself as an autocrat was not contrary to the revolution at all, but the next logical step in Bolshevik thinking, and neither Lenin or Trotsky would have completely disagreed with him- both of them were anti-liberal mass murderers in their own right; the main difference between them is the number of zeros that Stalin put on the kill quotas."
"A good chunck of those didn't fail, they did exactly what they set up to do."
"One of the main problems that revolutions face is that the revolutionary forces need to be a minimal coalition in the sense that, once they take power, the support of every constituent group is necessary to maintain the government and that swapping any one of them for some other faction would also hurt one of the other original groups. If this is not the case, then the other factions would be tempted to remove said other group in order to claim more power for themselves and the government would devolve into infighting (as a side note, that is why I consider corporate governments as portrayed in many cyberpunk stories to be unrealistic: shareholders rely on the legal system for their power and so, after the company takes over, they would be easily moved out of the way without risking a loss of control (unless they have the backing of some foreign government), but that means that they would want to prevent the company from getting into a position where it might take power, in the first place). At the same time, the revolutionary forces also need to be strong enough to even remove the current government, but the revolution will likely change the balance of power between the factions and so it is very difficult to meet both of those requirements, at the same time. The 'traditional' solution to this problem is to have the revolutionary forces be composed of very similar groups (so the balance of power is unlikely to shift much, between them), but then it is also very easy for them to set up a dictatorship, rather than anything bordering on democracy, to benefit themselves at the expense of the general populace."
"""Revolution bad. Fiction says so based on hyperbole.""

They're will always be reactionaries to f*ck it up and it's way easier to coopt and adapt an already existing system, I'll grant you that. That's why revolutions should focus on ""rotate and redirect"" (to reach a post- scenario) rather than ""turn-away and dissasemble"" (an anti- scenario that will inevitably revert back to an ultimately immovable status quo). Now, what kind of revolutions you think most privileged people are more eager to support?

If you want a successful post-revolution, we need to start by accepting that ""maybe our position should be lowered"" in order to stabilize everything.... but we're most selfish idiots grown on idioticly individualistic circumstances, the last think we will want collective is to risk our comfortable position get the chance of a more sustainable one. So, once you understand that, well, welcome to humanity's dead-end, especially if you ""get it, but..."".

I'll grab the pop corn, we're f*cked either way, better try to reach and enjoy ""the credits""."
"@HelloFutureMe Responding to the ""positive view of the past"" point- in the USA, we had some good legislation in the past that was eroded over decades. When I say glowing things about the 1950's, it's usually specific like ""our tax of 91% of any dollar of income over 3 million dollars (equivelent of 3 million today i should say) was really good at keeping income inequality down."" or ""the regulations separating investment accounts and savings accounts in banks helped prevent economic bubbles like we saw in 2007."" 
If one is specific about their praise of the past, its totally fine. It's vague support of the past that kinda runs into the problems you point out in your video.

"Seems to me that it wasn't' very much against Lenin his desires Tim. Considering he was very much ordering purges and invasions, not to mention deconstructing democratic institutions. Everything Stalin did was very much in line with Lenin."
its wild to me how 1% of the species believes itself to be 50%+ and really thinks it deserves to own and control 90%+ of the resources. delusions of grandeur and massively inflated egos make people do and think some really strange stuff. like people believing in evolution solely because it gives them a route to believe in eugenics which gives them a reason to think its ok to murder 99% of your own species while no other species does anything like that on earth or elsewhere.
"Stalin autocracy/dictatorship is pure anticommunist propaganda(mostly from the Holodomor nazi-fascist defamatory work) trotskist propaganda that fuels liberal anticomunism by posing itself idealistically against any and all real socialist nations and politics.
The great hunger of China as something man made and genocidal is also similar anticommunism. There was a hunger, but it was mostly due to one of the harshest environmental factors/disasters than for ill-management of resources and definitively not for authoritarianism, which has no material basis whatsoever."
"hate to tell you this, mr well off hw!te guy, but the only people who have any stability in their lives in any country where eurocentric culture has measurable influence, are well off hw!te people and those who try to be them. thats less than 1% of the human species. why revolutions ever failed in the past was mostly because of communication and information control. they never had the historical reference to understand the power vacuums that are created when pocket revolution happens (revolution in a single country / area) are always going to be taken advantage of by european loyalists. they are the people who started off with a huge head start in wealth from using guns to plunder as much of the world as they could before they became common technology. so they are always going to have resources to throw at trying to own and control other places. thats why the only way for the world to ever escape from underneath the boot of european monarchs is to simultaneously eliminate every little part of the eurocentric ruling class so there will be no one left to make those orders and then we can restore the quintillions of dollars worth of wealth to the rest of the world so that there will be no reason for anyone to try to conquer others. because everyone will have everything they could ever want or need without european monarchies stealing it all from us."
Awesome video.
"You SERIOUSLY need to read up on what happened in Egypt if that's the example you mean to use. Mursi only had the support of the Muslim brotherhood, he wasn't a official MB candidate. He wasn't ousted by secular forces but by Gulf state intervention funding al-Sisi with hundreds of millions of dollars. They also astroturfed an entire movement, Tamarod, to sabotage democracy in Egypt. This whole narrative that there were ""quarrelling factions"" is way too simplistic and fails to take into account the immense international interest in controlling the struggling new little democracy. Al-Sisi has committed horrible atrocities so far."

Ukraine and Georgia had many revolutions over the years. Unfortunately, each time the government devolved into corruption, Russian influence is overwhelming, and in time, they infiltrate and corrupt any government we have.

"To destroy a totalitarian regime you need power (police/military) which then also wants power. 
The only way a revolution really can work is when every child and every person in the state is ready to die or suffer for freedom and not care about their own security, health or the ones you love.
If you give up freedom for security you will in the end lose both. 
This way you can even get a peaceful revolution. What does a military do when the whole population stands up and just marches peacefully against them accepting death and torture till they stop the power."

"This video missed other details from the Russian Revolution that would also set the seeds for Stalin's rise.

Lenin did NOT start the revolution, nor did the Soviets. Lenin was a rich intellectual who coopted everything and used force to collapse the existing revolutionary government, which that was already instable and likely to fail.

Lenin was already laying out the same institutions that Stalin used, Stalin just used them more brutally and more effectively. And note Lenin was SENT by the German monarchy to Russia to cause chaos in order to get Russia out of WW1. Which that was all Germany wanted, to remove a enemy from the war.

And then we got the Russian Civil war, where those who were the rebels who overthrew the Tzar were now fighting ""against the revolution and for the monarchy"" against the rise of Lenin's Soviets, which of course lead to the need to oppress and genocide lets of people."

"As a Thai person who is living in a country that is undergoing massive social revolution, your series looking into the complexity of revolution has been very interesting to me as many of your points resonates with what is going on right now in Thailand. For example: how people who are on the same side with the revolutionaries might not even understand or be into the revolution's ideology... They just HATE the current regime who is being cartoonishly evil to the point that they are even dumbly alienating the upper class people in the society. (Many of my associates are politicians in the Move Forward Party that I guess would be the revolutionaries in our current situation. They are quite surprised that they have gained this much support this quickly as they had previously expected that it would take some times for the conservative Thai society to get behind their heavily liberal ideologies. They didn't expect that the regime will act this stupidly and become ridiculously hatable.)"
"I really-really love these newer type of video ideas from you. Youre (not) comparing fantasy/sci-fi world building to real life, rather, you show how some of those concepts have inflicted people irl. Based"
"The first I reminded me of Peter Turchin. According to Turchin, instability can be attributed to two factors: popular well being and elite overproduction.

Popular well being has to do with how well people are doing. It is made up of four categories: employment prospects, relative wage, health, and family.

Employment Prospects: This has to do with labor supply in proportion to labor demand. More supply in proportion to demand lessens prospects for workers.

Relative wages: This metric measures income inequality which is calculated by finding the difference between GDP per capita (average) and median wages (median).

Health: This measures expectation of life and average height.

Family: People tend to get married when they're ready to settle down. This can happen sooner when economic conditions are good. In 1890, grooms were, on average 26/27 while brides were 23/24. The age hit its all time low in the 50s when labor power was at its all time strongest and houses were cheap. Grooms were 24 and brides were 20/21. Today,  the age is at an all time high of 30 for first time grooms and 28.6 for first time brides.


Elite overproduction refers to the number of qualifying elites compared to the number of positions available. There are three categories: top wealth, cost of education, and elite fragmentation.

Top wealth: Wealth of the wealthiest person divided by median income

Cost of education: Cost of attending an elite university divided by median income

Elite fragmentation: Political polarization

Popular well being is important because people want to thrive. When that is not the case, people look for answers to their problems. When people do not thrive, revolution does. The people leading the revolution are disgruntled elites who are looking for a way to seize power and use a revolution to do so. Increasing income inequality does both. It decreases popular well being as some fall from the middle class into the lower class. On the other hand, some rise into the upper class, leading to elite overproduction. In a democratic society, it results in the cost of winning elections rising as more people vye for positions and as the amount of money which can be spent on elections increases."
"Brilliant video. I don't think that necessarily revolutions are that impossible, but they're certainly much more complicated than people think"
Just a little nitpick. Any pretense of democracy in USSR was already gone by the time Lenin took power. It's situation was not very different from what happened in Egypt post revolution. Stalin was just the dictator's henchman killing all the other henchmen after the first dictator died.
"Terry Pratchett put it best. When revolutionaries do things for the people they quickly find that they've got the wrong type of people.

How you respond to that is how you find out where you are on the morality scale."
Great video! Scary how quickly a revolution can start oppressing people
I used to be a communist I know what eat the rich really means. It means I'm poor and mad butt hurt.
I feel the last 3 books of the red rising series does it very good. D caosh and in fighting after a revulutions
"I think the best way for a revolution to not devolve into a dictatorship is to maintain democratic systems early on in the rebellion, and focus attention both outward against the oppressors and within, helping people who are part of the revolution (and maybe a few extra civilians who might need it). In that regard, i think my favorite revolutionary character is not Hobie Brown from AtSV, but Ekko from Arcane. First of all, Ekko is just cool. but more importantly, he isn't just focused on bringing down Silco's drug empire, but his hideout is its own new society, protecting those in need, etc. it's honestly brilliant. granted he was only doing it for max 7 years, but still, that's impressive."
"Maybe the revolution is just evil from the beginning, much more so than the regime they are trying to overthrow. Look at the communist party of China, it already has a terrible track record and did a good job covering it up before it seized power. 
Or maybe both the revolution and the old regime are terrible. A good example of this might be the Soviet-occupied Afghanistan."
"You have to be a leftist, as you justified racial based revenge on the implication that the 'benefiters were white' and also implied class based revenge is good"
"Revolution redistributes resources, and there will always be people who don’t want their resources to be redistributed, upset that their resources got redistributed, or want to be redistributed with more resources, upset that they didn’t get redistributed enough. 

But the political and economical mess is less interesting than the battles and strategies. You often end up with great lengths of boring world building and setting dumps to the face."
"No revolution has ever been initiated by the people; they are all formed and funded by elites, so revolutions are always just elites engaged in squabbles. The masses never dictate anything or cause any actual change; it is all elites. Modern first-world democracies are just elites ruling, with voting just being a means to establish the *_Illusion of Legitimacy;_* first-world oafs think that because they can vote that their government is legitimate; democracies are just as corrupt, if not more so, than any other form of government. They just legalize their corruption via more complex systems, thus meaning they are more protected and the people are blamed for not voting for the right person

If the masses suddenly started to believe that it takes a Divine Right to rule, the elite would stop holding elections and make claims to having Divine Right, thus establishing an illusion of legitimacy via Divine Right"

"Even Americans today want Socialism. Combine that with an idealization of the past...

"Good information on the infighting that happens post revolutions, and why that infighting happens. Unfortunately claiming that sanctions on Cuba or North Korea are in any way justified and not crimes against humanity is bad. It further pushes the US narrative that any type of socialism is terrible, socialists want to be respected as humans not viewed as an expense to increase someone else’s profit. The United States attacks on socialists pushes them towards more authoritarian measures to protect their revolutions."

"Soo...... what I took away from this was, we need to eat the rich...."
"I'd like to point out a possibility that may make a lot of people uncomfortable, but if it does make you uncomfortable, I'd encourage yall to interrogate that discomfort a bit.

Now, obviously the USSR committed some atrocities, and did some horrible things. But the statistic Tim brings up, and then immediately writes off as ""people idealizing the past,"" about a lot of Russians wishing the USSR hadn't been dissolved... could actually be because life was better for them under the USSR. 

I think it's important to recognize that nobody is immune to propaganda, and most people in the west have lived our entire lives constantly consuming media and information that has been intentionally filtered through the cultural hegemony of the United States. So maybe, just maybe, those people aren't in some way delusional for wishing that they had a system that at least *attempted* to address the fundamental conflicts at the heart of capitalism, rather than the oligarchy they have now that was imposed on them by a foreign power.


...

Again, none of that is USSR apologia. it simply includes a recognition of the good alongside the bad, and if that makes you uncomfortable, I'd really suggest doing some introspection about potential dogmas you might have."
"The revilution failed after it won because they assumed fighting a group of people/a person,and not a idea/fascism?"
"I think about these things like a 2x2 grid. You can be either a radical or a moderate in terms of methods and in terms of ends. You can have a very moderate person who doesn't want very much change at all and just doesn't like the current dictator who is fully willing to launch an insurrection and fight their neighbors for power. I think of Thomas Jefferson or George Washington who was fully radicalized in terms of methods but who were, in retrospective, leading quite a moderate revolution that didn't even free the slaves. It doesn't get more radical in in terms of methods than forming a militia and overthrowing the government. 

You can also have hardcore radicals aiming at full communism who are scared of even picking up a gun. Folks like Ledru Rollin or Martov or other ""Democratic Socialists"" are aiming for full communism eventually in their lifetimes but they just don't have the stomach for violence. They put far too much hope in peaceful protests, petitions, strikes, and democracy. 

And of course you can have peaceful moderates and violent extremists. Those are standard archetypes."
"I remember reading this somewhere.
When the Mau Mau ""Rebellion"" ended, the Kikuyu marched to the government center with their weapons then threw them in a pile on the ground.
If that is true, then, they are the only morally justified revolutionaries in all of human existence."
"I wonder if Tim has read any of Trotsky's issues with ""Socialism in one country."" If i remember correctly, it's part of the theory of ""permanent revolution,"" wherein a socialist state cannot succeed on its own. That, in order for the revolution to achieve communism, it must be a global revolution, so that outside powers are less able to interfere and disrupt an already ideologically messy situation.

Also as I've seen some others in the comments say, I'd love to see an episode on why revolutions succeed. This has been an interesting series so far, but a bit of a downer, and I'd be interested to see Tim's take on the successes of Cuba, the black panthers, or Thomas Sankara's Burkina Faso. It may not have been long lasting, but in the time that Sankara was president he did some really incredible work. And writing a successful revolution would help give me a little bit more hope for the future since neoliberal reform has been shown to be completely ineffective in both the fight against fascism, and the restoration of the planet's ecology. Oh and if anybody wants a little more reading material on that last bit, I highly recommend Rosa Luxembourg's ""Reform or Revolution"""

{Mu-BAR-ak}
I want a history class taught by you.
"I came up with a story idea for a Third World War resulting in a new restructuring of the global order. Then, almost a century later, a conflict colloquially called 'The Fourth World War' breaks out, officially titled 'The Great Insurrection'. Essentially, it's a global uprising against the new order, comprising the last few warlords and dictators, extremists of all kinds and 'traditional democrats', who want to return to pre-WWIII governance. Despite initial success, the Insurrectionists utterly fail because:
1) Not enough people are dissatisfied with the governments. While spectacular success is extremely rare, the norm is competent governance, including a stable, strong economy, and oppression isn't much of an issue. 
2) The governments have vastly superior resources. They can build more tanks in a year than the Insurrectionists ever have, and completely outclass them in air power.
3) The governments have much more infrastructure. This also means the Insurrectionists can take places and facilities, but if the governments decide it's too much trouble to retake it, they can just bomb or shell it into oblivion. While the Insurrectionists can gain victory, it's extremely hard for them to actually win anything. 
4) While the rebel factions all want the united governments gone, few of them agree on what should come in their place. The governments have a clear plan for the future: just get on with things as before. The rebels, though... a return to liberal democracy? A Fourth Reich, be it global or more local? A Caliphate? The Insurrectionists are painfully aware that if, by some miracle, they actually overthrow the governments, they'd immediately start bickering among themselves."

"While it's all well and good to not romanticize previous eras, a very important thing to remember is to not overjudge them. We, as modern people, can look around and see a lot of the stuff spewed on the news is heavily propagandized. You absolutely need to remember that this was probably ALWAYS the case. If our Internet era is rife with lies and misdirection (even from our current governments and the UN), then it must have been around back then too—and with no one to really contest it. Never take the romanticized version for granted, but also don't whitewash the institutions that relay history to us. Again and again, from the sugar industry buying health research to Alzheimer's research based on illegitimate research, we learn that even our sources of information can be wrong."

"One thing I'd point at is that revolutions tend toward extremes, which while understandable because it's those extremes which drive people to fight more than a centre position, but it makes them brittle like raw iron. A stable system is one which incorporates many elements of different systems to cover weaknesses, like good spring steel. Constitutional monarchy providing separation of powers (among many other things) plus democratic legislation seems a winning combo for example, which very few revolutions have attempted."
"Great video, leaving a comment for the algorithm"
"Small problem with calling the Communist Revolution a ""rebellion against tyranny"", because the Communists were rebelling against a democratic process that voted to keep the monarchy."

"Sometimes success is failure, as the high ideals (if any) run up against the aftereffects of the violence and the need to get everything working again."
"This is a great look into some of the reasons revolutions are more complicated in real life than in fiction; though I think there is perhaps a good reason few fictional stories explore the subject properly, and the main reason is that complexity. Usually a story has a protagonist who is a specific person, or at most a half dozen people, but a real revolution requires a significant chunk of the population to be involved. The antagonist is normally also a single individual, but in a real revolution it is the existing institutions, often inherently impersonal. A lot of revolution are really just power fantasies, a protagonist overcoming the authorities that frustrate us in the real world. Most of the rest work on the level of metaphor. The government does things in such a bizarre way and unrealistic way because it is a metaphor for something else; it might not even be about government policy. A dystopia where people are separated into castes might just be a metaphor for how people are forced into certain social roles because of they rely on stereotypes and assumptions to understand others and themselves. The authority of a government works as a metaphor for how difficult it is to resist the widespread human tendency."
"You took out the dictator but you don't have money printers and you get all of your money from neighboring countries who will give you said money...for oil ...oil...that is more important than food and jobs. And telling people that their well being is more important than oil....is not on the table because people apparently don't just want to have stability...or maybe all the oil was given to your rich friends in exchange for weapons. Weapons that was used to take down the dictator just for that extra.... complications.

No money...no way to get money because your country only have one commodity...the same commodity you no longer own....and the rich is selling the commodity you gave them ...but are hording the money and are not using it to rebuild the the very same place they live in ...the same place that just had a dictator removed by force because he was awfully mean.

The rich that gave you weapons in exchange for the oil you my now need...are kinda...stupid....you just killed a dictator for not meating the needs of the people...why would they think that you wouldn't think what they are doing is immoral and kill them like how you killed the dictator?

Maybe most of them are part of factions and are hiding behind crowds of people... maybe this was always the plane and they are already convincing crowds of people to take you out and let them be the new leaders even tho they have no plans on sharing the money they get from oil sales.
This is some fucked shit but I can see this being a call of duty game."
"My only problem with this video is that you went on about and why revolutions fail. Yes, we've seen that happen a lot in history. However, you never went into how a revolution can survive navigating the problems you've illustrated. If the implication of the video is 'don't do this', then I'm a little disappointed that there was no example for it in the first place and it seems like a mealy mouthed way of saying that revolutions are doomed to fail and modern democracy is equally doomed to fail."
"My country is every once in a while flirting with the idea of a revolution, and honestly I want change but I'm anxious about civil war and worry that the religious side would completely take over.
But knowing how power works I know that positive change is impossible, that even if it benefits me it's at the detriment of someone else.
This kind of video just kinda stokes my anxiety unfortunately...

also, I know and love some religious people. they are kind, intelligent, I don't want them to change, they are capable of tolerance.
But their goddamned representatives are evil, lgbt hating, war mongering, who want the rest of society to fund their bullshit, and whenever somebody needs public funding, ""it offends the feelings of religious people"".
to reiterate, I know religious people. It does not offend them.
they can look at a woman without busting a nut, and if they get too uncomfortable, they're adults who can look away"

"Honestly, the idea that a revolution is like a flame is a good one. Early on, if not properly taken care of, they die out before they get started.

Once it gets going, you wonder how long can the fire keep going as well as it’s intensity. You’ll need to put it out eventually.

And if you’re not careful, it can become a raging inferno that destroys everything in its path."

I’m so glad you made these videos on revolution. I’ve been working on this story set during the Russian Revolution for years now and the hardest part for me has been trying chronicle how the revolution evolved from starting with more noble intentions and then became authoritarian. These videos helped so much.
"I feel like every time people talk about revolutions failing, the forget most African states fought for independence and won. Most of them without international support.
I wonld say most revolutions achieve their goals, they just don't last because most are never built to. Especially in the examples given. I feel these are reactionary revolutions, where people are forced ro edge and just snap back. There Other revolutions which are quiet, and those go further because their goal and process is always long term."

"Stalin? Aspiring to a democratic, liberal republic? Lenin returned to Russia to *prevent* that, and Stalin was nowhere near as pluralist, let alone democratic, as Lenin. Historians differ on whether Stalin ever even believed in Marxism/Leninism, just hated capitalists, or just hated everybody with authority who wasn't him."

Kinda hard if the US devalred war on you or assissinates your leader.
"I love your videos, and found the precursor to this very good, but this one lacked the same nuance in favour of a common narrative on socialist countries that they ""failed"" when it is not so simple. They significantly improved material conditions, provided an alternative axis of power to capitalist hegemony, provided political liberation that should not be dismissed despite the abuses and their failure came from external attack as much as internal contradictions. 

The best attempt at grappling with the complexity was probably The Poppy War which I am surprised didn't get a mention."
"What is it with leftists being historically illiterate? I say this as a socialist. The USSR, PRC, DPRK and others are, have and probably always will be states that fly in the face of the core tenets of socialism. ""Worker"" states that consistently repress its populations to ensure total power for the ruling party, where the proletariat have no meaningful way other than mass protest to change state policy, where voting is often just an outright sham to give a veneer of legitimacy, and where the workers have no control over their workplace or its conditions.

 Its funny to me how many of the countries thst these places condemn as oppressive to the proletariat have made more meaningful progress to socialism, then those who claim to champion its ideals have. 0:01"
There is a TV show I watched a while ago called ‘Tyrant’. It shows a reasonably good example of this with a brother going home to his family who runs a dictatorship. And this brother wants to change it to a democracy because he’s lived in America and seen the freedoms. It’s a good exploration of how it’s just not so simple.
With a democracy it takes decades to get anything done but that also should mean it takes decades to go to war.
This helped me realize how lucky the USA was that George Washington didn't want to be king.
Thats why any serious revolution needs a vanguard party that leads them. Lenin and Stalin won the revolution and lead the union into a stable and better time. They only fucked up afterwads
The Bolshevik Revolution wasn't liberal. Stalin was.
18:04 THANK YOU. I completely agree!!! So glad you pointed this out.
"Excellent video, also foreign interests for revolutions are quite important as well."
"Problem with revolutions is that they involve redistribution of property. A selective nullification of rights, often based on subjective criteria. And that becomes the foundation of the new system. What rights do you think you''ll have under the new regime? It's pretty obvious. Same rights as the last rulers."
"In truth the real dilemma in modern day revolutions is trying to keep track of all the CIA psyops and not accidentally confusing a real faction with an American or Russia oligarch's funded ones.(I say oligharch, not gov because the myth of the American gov being anything to do with the American people or voters is just that, a myth. In truth both sides is just a bunch olicharchs trying to out buy political avatars for their set goals[senators/reps] while maximizing lobbying on the same budget. Voters only choose city and lower gov officials.  

Iran is actually one of the only countries that successfully realized their revolution was a CIA psyop mid revolution. They were able to successfully shake them by retreating to the mosques where CIA surveillance simply couldn't be fully implemented. By using a deeply local and regional religion as essentially a gatekeeper to political voice it masterfully screened out all western voices. The unfortunate consequences of this is a totalitarian theocracy.  Iran looked exactly like America in 1950. By 1980 it was something totally alien to the west and appeared as though a nation regressed to medieval times. 

Thanks CIA, everyone loves you so much. The entire world including your own citizens don't secretly pray for your destruction. No, you certainly have a secure future here in America."
"Watching this reminded me of a political science professor I had who raved about military coups. He had nothing but good things to say about times when the military would take over a government.

He was from Eritrea, so from his lived experience being from an unstable part of Africa, the military were the ones deposing corrupt governments and restoring democracy. The way he explained it, solders are the lower classes and no one joins the military to get rich. When they take over, it's the common people ousting the corrupt upper class.


And since the military already has a built in command structure and established organization, you don't have this post revolution chaos talked about here.

As an American, this perspective was wild."
"Revolutions fail because they are not evolutions.  It is like a needle on a record; going back to the same basic position just in a different groove.
I think it would help if countries who claim to be democratic would have publicly funded, heuristic democratic free schooling that concentrated on consensus based democratic process.  It is really hard to do, so why are we not teaching people the processes for attempting to take on this challenge of dealing with ideological disagreements that happens even within a group who loosely agrees with each other on many things?"
"You talk about it being wrong to blame minorities. Firstly,  the groups you talk about as problems, elites, militaries and so on, are minorities. Secondly, I guess you think about ""minorities"" here meaning some ethnical minorities, some times the problem actually is some ethnical minorities, as we see now in Western Europe."
"This is all addressed matter of factly in ""The Dictators Handbook"", CG Grey summarized it in a funny and to the point video ""Rules for Rulers"". It basically comes down to no King rules alone. 

Except for conservative/reformist events like the Great and American I'm not aware of any revolution since the English civil war that didn't make things infinitely worse in the short and long term. 

Maybe real revolution has just never been tried before. This time fore sure."
"A good counter question would be: How have revolutions in the past succeeded? Why are Cubans so happy and satisfied with their government, despite crippling sanctions?"
"To me Far Cry 6 shows that dictatorship and revolution are two sides of the same coin think about it Anton's father was for all intents a revolutionary, he promised the people of Yara a change from where they were for better or worse, and asked them to believe his message. Eventually he had an army of soldiers who basically worshiped him. But some people hated the price for this change so they became the Legends and eventually killed Anton's father and tortured Anton for something he didn't even know remember Anton's father didn't give him half the lessons he gives to Diego. After being thrown to the streets with his mom he rose again and just like his father rebelled against something; the image everyone gave to him he showed everyone that he wasn't his father and promised to change Yara with Viviro and asked the people to believe in his message. Keep in mind petty things like revenge were never on his mind he was just fine to leave the Legends alone on their mountian. But when he put his plan with Viviro into motion some people hated the price for it. So after Anton spread the idea of ""True or Fake"" Yarans and Libertad was born and Clara asks the people to believe her message as they rebelled against Anton's entire life and if given the chance they'd might do the same thing to Diego. Look at Juan out of all the Legends he was probably living his worst life after 67 with no war to win he didn't matter anymore. But when Libertad comes around fighting Anton and he has a new enemy to hate his balls grow so big he talks about writing a book on revolution next tl his crocodile  in front of the bartender he knows wants to sell him out. Look at his diolouge he talks about revolution like it's his favorite drug he even calls Dani a junkie. Soon Dani and Diego get involved they both rebel, Dani fights against Anton all while Diego rebels against what people think about him being a spoilt brat and even Dani gets  to see that side of him unlike everyone else. And after he hears Anton talk about what happend to him and his father he realizes all of this and essentially tells Juan that too, and after Diego dies he still in a way rebelled when offered the job of president and just walks away telling them not to f*ck it all up but after that he's done he told his message and he's not asking anyone to believe in him. You can't have peace without war just like how a dictator can't be hated without a revolution they're both the problem."
💜👍
"No revolution can ever promise anything except an end to the status quo. At some point, that's enough of a promise to start one."
"People don't realize how Amazing the success of the American revolution really was. Most revolutions inevitably to Civil War and dictatorship. 

The fact that America managed to avoid this is very remarkable,  And I would say ultimately comes down to the character of the founding fathers. 



Ultimately all of them wanted America to succeed More than they wanted anything else."
Sorry to break it to you but the map of soviet union is wrong on 8:06
"""I'm not saying we shouldn't sanction north korea""...
I hate hearing liberal westerners minimalise and disparage revolutions in 3rd world countries. The red scare and nato talking points used in this video are also very obvious. Sucks to see especially from someone who represents himself as a leftist."
Not going to lie Tim I'm a little concerned but I'm reading to follow along with you on this one
"I think a really cool follow-up to this video would be an exploration, perhaps with hypothesization of how you or others may believe the founding fathers tackled this issue, and how the United States managed to avoid collapsing to this point. Democracies are stable as you said, so there is more resistance to ideological splintering. George Washington said don’t split into political factions, Lincoln said a house divided cannot stand. So how did we lose this mentality in the modern day and are the days of the US golden age numbered?"
Weirdly enough Fable 3 of all games tries to show this.
"FINALLY, my favourite part of revolutions! The intellectuals who think that their unrealistic imaginings are correct and the world is wrong for not living up to them."
"Good video but I have to take issue with how you make it seem like Stalin was the one who made the Soviet Union descend into brutal autocracy. 
First, Lenin and the bolsheviks did not overthrow the Tsar, the Tsar was overthrown in the February Revolution, after which a provisional government was formed and later a Constituent Assembly elected, the bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government and dissolved the Constituent Assembly in the October revolution because they didn’t get a majority in the election.
Lenin persecuted political enemies, „undesirables“ like the kulaks and clergymen. Instituted the Red Terror (Called that by the bolsheviks themselves! Referencing the Terror in the French Revolution), waged war on „member states“ that didn’t want to be part of the Soviet Union like Ukraine, caused or worsened famines with his efforts to build a command economy and collectivize the agricultural sector, established a secret police and ruled as a dictator for the rest of his life.
Stalin may have been a particularly brutal dictator but Lenin is the one who build the soviet tools of oppression, was the first to use them and smothered any hope of russian democracy in its crib and he should always be remembered as the monster that he was."
"Ummm, Lenin was not a nice guy. He is the same guy who brought on Stalin. Lenin wanted a continuous world revolution. Hence why HIS army invaded Poland. Stalin simply continued that. They were both terrible people."
Operation Ajax was a counterevolution
the splintering of factions spawned out of Poland's Solidarity movement is facinating

"This video although i am sure well intentioned becomes another anti revolutionary propaganda, instead of any type analisys based on class struggle we are faced with a narritive devoid of any actual history.I am a fan of the channel and i did feel like this type of video was sadly going to come.
The video especially suffers through its definition of revolution no actual distiction is made between capitalist revolutions(like the french one) and communist ones(like october or cuban) as said before this of course happens due to the lack of class analysis what material reasons other than ""people are hungry"" give rise to revolutions in the first place,the arab springs for example are called ""revolutions"" but they didnt adressed the underline structure of their societies they seek regime change in the form of more democratic rights while not actually attacking their own ruling class which holds power not merely through political offices but the political and economic structure of society itself,the same capitalist who supported the dictatorships are now the same who control the democratic system.The english civil war another example(one of the most early capitalist revolutions),its not called a revolution by name but you had the english aristocracy against the english upcoming capitalist class represented then by the house of commons,even though they were the ones who drove the economy becoming wealthier and wealthier ,they were not in control of state and the economy themselves due to the fact that they were structured to represent and have on top the aristocracy in this struggle the capitalists had to rely more and more to the support of the peasants(just like in the french one) .
Lets adress the big elephant the ussr, in the video no actual source or analysis of why the infighting was happening just the claim what it was done due to ideological diffrences and it was used by stalin to gain autocratic power.Obsviously this falls into the category of the great man theory its the reduction of soviet revolutionary history the struggle of building socialism reduced to individuals who control entire nations, while of course not having any source.I know the aim of the video is not to be a history documentary but we cant talk about all these without examining historical sources.Workers councils(soviets) the diffrent factions within the communist party and their disagreements are not presented, the structure of the soviet system is not analysed of course its just simply autocratic with not needing to question anything simply relying on our already extisting biases which are created by the very capitalist society that we live in, we have all heard that the ussr was evil and that revolutions fail why provide a source?The reduction of the english civil war to the ambitious cromwell(who was an awful character) and the corrupt members of the house of commons is idiotic.Its like saying ww2 happened because of hitler or ww1 due to the assasination of the austrian prince!This narrative of revolution fail because power corrupts is used becouse it benifits the existing ruling capitalist class for us to not further examine the actual questions of our day how does this fucked up system actually works?how does it lead to wars?And how do we change it?The ussr with its mistakes was that awnser to not actually examine its democratic institutions that had the working class through workers councils(soviets) in power and how they worked as well as their actual mistakes and why they failed is a disservice to ourselves and to anyone who wants to actually change the world for the better!

Not a good video i am sorry Tim"
"I gotta ask....do revolutions actually work.
Top of my head, the one that worked (.... somewhat 😑) is the American Revolution.

The most famous French Revolution didn't become a Republic (by modern standards) until....like 30 years later

....the Velvet revolution worked, true.
But, my cynical brain keeps thinking that if a revolution happens, benefits will come about like a generation or two later."
"I've often thought about the daydream, where I become the individual who controls the world. There is some sort of fantasy that I would be able to solve all the injustices and inefficiencies in the world, but as I go through the daydream and consider the logical implications of what I would need to do to maintain power, ultimately I arrive at an authoritarian regime, perhaps more concentrated in power than in 1984. How does one control the populace and prevent them from revolting? How does one make sure that the elite do not turn against you? The only solutions I can come up with that are absolute in terms of their result is a police state that monitors and make sure dissents are put down thoroughly and swiftly. Gaining power is difficult, but governing is even more so."
"With all due respect, but since this is a very complex and loaded topic it's pretty inappropriate you just present it as if it was another light matter of storytelling and worldbuilding with this catchy 3-i-model.

With all constructive and well-meaning sincerity I recommend you look into Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Namely the remarks about the French Revolution and the relation between freedom and terror), Adorno and Horkheimers Dialectic of Enlightenment, Machiavelli and for good measure 'The Art of War'

I'm sorry but you really painfully overreached in competency right here."
"The end reminded me of the Whiskey Rebellion, where President Washington sent the US Army to put down a rebellion about taxation on whiskey.   Yeah, everyone can hear the historical parallels."
"Revolutionaries are the kind of people who, upon realizing they don't like the way their parents are running the house, they kill their parents and burn the house down, only to soon realize that they still need a house to live in and now they're all alone with the same problems their parents were confronting but with less resources to solve them."

"I've actually been trying to write a story about revolution and how negative actors could manipulate The idealistic to get what they want. It's probably best to see the additions and the subtractions of such things.

Anyway, great series of videos."
Would you say the United States is an exception here? or is it just as corrupt as any other post-revoluntionary state?
Dictatorship is the only thing that can save us from the ultimate wickedness of democracy
Have you read any socialist theory?

"Not sure what I'm watching here.  I've read a bit of social science, and his models seem very different from what I've read.  He gives no citations in the show notes, and starts the video talking about creative ""fiction"" and ""world building"".
So, I think I'm just going to call BS and go watch something believable."

Only starting the video. Did he ever mention Red Rising?
I like thinking about the Emperor and the Thunder Warriors in Warhammer 40k. He used them to essentially fight his revolution but once he was done he had them killed because they didn't fit his future and had served their purpose.

Lore of Why Revolutions Fail momentum 100
"Interesting video but I disagree with some of your points. For one, your argument that the 50s were bad for women and black people. That's a common myth. Life was actually much better and in fact much of the tension in society that existed among racial lines were due to the improved prospects both groups gained. Much of the racism, for instance, was due to black people - having benefited from the economic improvements following the war - being able to afford to move to neighborhoods that were, until then, out of reach. Women also benefited. Forced abortion was less common with the improved economic situation. That's an area of history that never gets addressed because people support it today for certain minority groups and poor women(hence why crisis pregnancy centers keep getting attacked). 
Another thing to note is the left-right dichotomy is kind of a lie at best. Revolutionary governments are almost always leftwing with the only difference being that some are more nationalistic than others. However even the Soviet Union was nationalistic. The main political difference is whether the intent of the revolution is to try to save the bourgeois class(traditional urban upper class) or if the intent is to replace it. That's not a left-right issue. The average American Trump supporter despises the bourgeois class but you wouldn't call them leftwingers. Its this conflict that really defines a revolution. If a revolution is done with the intent on saving the bourgeois from collapse, then its going to often take on a racial dimension if the bourgeois is usually of a single race. However, if the revolution is done to get rid of the bourgeois, then there's no reason to care about race. You have to also keep in mind that a lot of the voices you hear on the internet are often influenced by factions you wouldn't associate them with. The average ""far right neo nazi"" is almost always either an employee of bourgeois nonprofit organizations or influenced by them. That's why they are so despised by the ""redneck"" Trump supporters - a conflict many try to ignore but shouldn't be ignored. 

One thing I do need to add is that the Prisoner's dilemma is often the sort of issue that causes a lot of infighting. Everyone has an incentive to backstab and thus its not only beneficial but also sometimes an important means for survival. Also legitimacy is a big issue and often one oppresses others to prevent others from siding with them against a revolution. Also societies are complex systems that can have lots of problems when instability is present. A revolution aimed at overthrowing the bourgeois may find itself enriching that same class and only destroying part of it. Or a revolution can destroy part of one class(like the aristocracy during the French Revolution) only to build up an even more oppressive class(such as the bourgeois in that same revolution)."

"Ngl I was part way into the video and you were like ""when you're writing a revolution"" and I was like ""oh yea, this video is about writing, not doing"""
You have a paper thin understanding of leftist politics and you just cater to online fascists
"Revolutions fail because CIA founds narco cartels(or mafia) and ultra right wingers to destabilize country, create the state of violance and ethnic violance to then create economic unstability, blame it all on socialism and Jews and then proudly talk how life is now better while you see your countryman picking food from trash to eat it."
"Oh yes I'm familiar with this map, I'm from the Grand Duchy of the Dom ;)"
"The biggest flaw with revolutions, is that common people sometimes do not understand the sacrifices that must be made to survive as a nation"
"Great video. People (myself very much included) often underestimate the complexity of revolutions. A good follow-up explaining the dynamics among the elites in a bit more detail might be CGP Grey's ""Rules for Ruler""-video (https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs?si=ph7nPW0BaMCdF_-R)"
Love your content brother. Keep up the great work
Bro has gone too far in the geopolitics rabbit hole. Snap back bro make avatar videos again 😅
"There was no ""privilege for russian people"" in USSR. Soviets invested tons of money into republics, delveloping their infrustructure and national policies (republics natives had to occupy the majority of important positions). Also one of the houses of USSR parlament was ""Soviet of nationalities"" consisting of each republic representatives. I mean, there was issues in national politics of USSR, but its nothing, compared to modern post-soviet countries. When all industry in ex-republics (middle Asia mostly) was destroyed, it lead to huge labour migration in Russia. Migrants face discrimination, horrible life and work condition and low wage"
"Great video. Very interesting.

Did you leave your auto-focus on by accident?"
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
"I loved the video dude, but I'd suggest keeping your hands out of it next time. Your camera couldn't decide to focus on with all of your exaggerated gestures, so it ended up making the entire thing out of focus nearly the entire time you were on screen."
"Most Americans that favor a return to 1950s culture do not romanticize racism or sexism of that time period. What they are romanticizing is the ability to start a business, raise a family, and be respected by their community. Today's system in America demonizes people that build businesses, attack the nuclear family, and encourage kids to hide secrets from their own families."
"Tim: Imagine you're from a small, economically unstable country without much international influence...
Me, watching from Zimbabwe: no need to imagine here😅."

"Really nice videos,  love your work disagree with a lot of your conclusions specially the ones regarding the USSR and Stalin but I understand that research time is limited and the most easily accessible sources are the go to in this kind of situations,  great work regardless"
Haven’t seen the one with the woman holding the shoe. I surmise that she’s a follower of the great prophet Brian.
"Money. It always comes down to money.
Human-rights costs money, especially when you make money off of places that violate human-rights."
I just listened to this part of your audiobook
The Goblin Horde reside within the nearby Goblin Kingdom where they review books and get really hype doing silly bits.
"My first thought that it depends heavily on the definition of failure. Like if the goal is to get rid of a dictator or monarch, he goes away and does mit come back, isn't that success? This seems to be aiming to define success as ""things don't get worse for normal people either long-term or ever?"" Or whether the person doing the overthrowing gets to stay in power? 

Imo the most successful revolutions tend to happen if there is a general ideally global view that a change is long overdue (ie when the Soviet union fell) and those tend to be not that much work (not causally so more that revolutions that take a lot of work and a lot of killing are much more likely create long-term scars in the population and of course plenty of easy revolutions where the dictator runs away quickly still fail)"
childish analysis. read peter dale scott and try again.
"Have you watched Andor? I think you'd like it, they tell the story of rebellion but from the perspective of individuals, how does one go from keeping their heads down to fighting oppression head on.
I think it has some really nice themes"
could you do a video about right wing coups?
"You present Stalin as an revolutionary leader, but it was Lenin and others. Stalin rose to power long after the revolution"
"Hey man. I like your videos normally, but these ones are leaving a bad taste in my mouth. 

I understand that the purpose of these videos is to write the best narrative possible, but I feel like you have your own limitations to come to grips with. 

I see that you're still looking at civil conflicts through the lens of who's the good guy and who's the bad guy? For storytelling purposes: I understand that's important, but to misrepresent real-life struggles in these terms is disingenuous to the struggles and to those who were a part of them. 

And yes I'm saying something because of the Stalin comments. There are bad things that the USSR had done under Stalin. There are bad things the the UK done under Winston Churchill. There are terrible things that the US done underneath Roosevelt. 

All three powers have this in common: they were democratic systems. Yes, even Stalin. You can find sources that indicate that Stalin didn't act solely off of executive orders, but by the votes of the Soviets (Councils). Did the Soviets vote for terrible things? Absolutely, such as the resettlement of the Tatars. The United States also did terrible things by placing every single Asian-American in internment camps.  Churchill had some interesting comments about Indians when they were suffering another famine during WW2. 

But my point is this: we have to examine further than the man. Stalin wasn't the only Bolshevik in that situation. And the Bolsheviks weren't the only belligerent group in Russia. See what the White Army and the Kulaks did to their own people during those times, and you'll understand why the Red Army did what they did. It's still screwed up, but every action has a pathology and list of reasons on why they did what they did. 

How many justified Thanos' extermination of half the universe? How many unironically defended Thanos' logic behind his atrocity? They're not right, but you understand where they may come from in a world that refuses to stop consuming beyond their means. 

There's surrounding material condition for all of these historical developments. And it has to be more than a ""God-given"" reason. That trope can work for fantasies like Lord of the Rings, but even Rings works because you see how far Sauron's minions are willing to go to fulfill his bidding. In Star Wars, yes the Empire is space Nazis, but they're not evil because of that. They're evil because they killed Luke's family and blew up Alderaan. And they don't plan on stopping either. We need to look beyond the Swastika. Otherwise, the hero is just punching somebody for wearing the wrong color and pattern. You're not mad at the ugly shade of red, you're mad at what it represents.

But yeah man. I would honestly consider the fact that we don't live under benevolent democracies either. But that's where it gets political and that's where I'm gonna end it. If you're going to refer to real-life historical events, I understand that writing is your focus, but trust me when I say that knowing the context makes your writing that much stronger. You're not just parroting what George Lucas already discovered, you're breaking beyond the mold."
Another big issue is how do you restore order in a way that isn’t violent and repressive as the old regime ?
"Issa series!😃
Not me only realizing that now 🤦"
"I love this!!! Honestly, this analysis feels so nice both for writing reference and also just...understanding real world current events and history and society and such. It is kind of sobering though, to think of just how hard it is to make a revolution work, and to consider all that's gone on in the world this past century. As an American, I feel like it's easy to romanticize revolutions, simply because the US had a relatively successful one...not without numerous problems, money being a big one, but it was probably made so much easier by the fact that Britain was an ocean away and the colonies had a preexisting governmental structure that could readily take over. It seems that to make a new government, you have to basically already have that structure in place, or you have to make one really fast, or else, the military is your structure, or something else. 

...or maybe, you could argue that we *all* romanticize revolutions of the more distant past, because we are so far removed, that we don't see the immediate growing pains that people back then would have experienced. So yeah, I think in writing, it is good to keep this stuff in mind...even when not writing a complete dramatic revolution outright. It's just a good study into human behavior and how factions interact, honestly"
"Might the propensity to idealize an autocratic past have an element of survivorship bias? The people most severely oppressed by such systems may well be no longer able to object. The rise of neo-facism coincides with the passing of the generation that directly experienced what OG racism meant. It's not the only factor, but it seems to be *a* factor."
"I hate the fact u think ur goverment is a democracy and whoever they deem as a dictator u agree. I cant take anyone as privlidged and blind to their own conditions with any sort of seriousness. I mean, u think kim is a dictator, while at the same time ignore the genocidal campaign ur country and their allies commited."
Can you please pick a more respectable fictional example than Hunger Games? It feels wromg talking about it in the same breath as IRL revolutions
Didn't you already post this video? EDIT: I guess I was wrong.
"I do need to point out that the vast majority of post-soviet countries follow the same trends you mentioned in this video for Russia. Older generations who actually lived under the soviets reflect those trends even more closely. At least for countries east of the Baltics, it's pretty undisputable that QoL went off a cliff after the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia has barely recovered decades later, Ukraine never did and now is being destroyed by war, and it's the same for a ton of he other soviet republics. It's also important to remember, anyone born after 1991 has spent their entire lives listening to propaganda tailored to demonize the last system in order to cement the current oligarch's rule. Pretty sure Putin wouldn't be so thrilled if Russians started reading Lenin.

Also, with China the Great Leap forward was a push to rectify the earlier agricultural failures; it was just badly implemented and multiple natural disasters occurred when the country was at its most vulnerable."
My GF was waiting for you to talk about Animal Farm this whole video
"What’s not appreciated here is that when governments are overthrown and there former evil henchmen are left in power after “re-educating” them it’s not just because the new elites don’t care it’s because they don’t have a choice

These individuals have been running and managing key sectors of the government for decades and have intimate knowledge on how all the systems are going to work which is different from how it “should” work. You cannot replace these people and often the depressing reality is that there crimes are often not worth punishing when the consequences of there absence is complete breakdown of any one essential service of government. And if you think about it just how responsible is a middle manager in these oppressive regimes? It’s a pretty grey area but the consequences for removing and replacing them unfortunately often out weight the benefits of “justice” (something that will have a very loose meaning by the end of your successful revolt) 

Unfortunately people don’t realize just how human all aspects of life is. There is no vanguard defending the people, it’s individuals acting in what they identify as there interest.

And often what you see as the obvious answer no one is talking about is actually a well walked road that leads to these oppressive outcomes. If you can think of this stuff in less than a 50 minute video a leader as contemplated these things for centuries and have disregarded them because there benefits are far outweighed by there disadvantages"
Man you really took a deep dive into revolutions
"Really interesting video. In essence it’s Animal Farm. I’m curious why there were so many examples of Stalin, but no mention of the true leader of communist revolution, Vladimir Lenin"
"You said ""man made famine."" but all famines are man made"
"I love the points you make here, but I feel that people need to realize that real world communism and fascism are two sides of the same coin. Both aim to deconstruct balanced society, which is obvious when you consider that they are both literally extremes on the political spectrum. There is value in compromise."
"It's a crime Disco Elysium isn't mentioned once as an example
Edit: I just wanted to mention disco elysium has very thoughtful writing on ideology and revolution and then I get a dude in my replies who is a proper communist from the game: complains only that others aren't communist enough while contributing nothing to the conversation."
Should get a degree in Political Science if you don't have one already
The failure of Indonesian Communist Party's revolution (and it's complete failure and subsequent annihilation) can also be an interesting case study
"How is it that you described Venezuela so well without even mentioning it? As a Venezuelan immigrant, I really appreciated this video, especially the Implementation section"
"Well, that was one of the more depressing educational videos I've ever seen 😅"
You should get more light on your face or turn of your cameras auto focus feature. It gets constantly confused and leaves your face blurry more often than sharp
U released this video at 4am. U workhorse
The glamour of revolution really dies when you realize how emotionally driven and how cruel they can be (sometimes even crueler than the very institutions they want to dismantle)
"""Chaos is a ladder"" is such a good quote"

"The point about the generous pension plan in the soviet union is cute, but the ussr collapsed because of economic mismanagment.
Regretting the time when they had those pensions is like regretting the time when you could burn as much oil as you wanted:
It never was sustainable"
"Revolutions can fail for so many reasons. For writing Revolutions, it might be good to show the Revolution failing, during or before the story."
The republic will be reorganize as the first galactic empire
Makes you wonder how Marxists like Second Thought and Hakim could deliver on their promises of a Post-Capitalist society since they can’t be satisfied by Voting Democrat every election.
Tim's revolutionary arc
Videos involving Stalin always bring such charming people. One of the first comments is a tankie denying that Stalin was even an autocrat at all.
All rebels are closet aristocrats (so said by dune god emperor lol)
"this is why anarchism is probably the hardest way to go, and the only way to go. if we want to be free, we have to do it ourselves. we have to unionize/democratize our workplaces, then spread that movement to all neighboring businesses we work with. once enough businesses are democratized, the contracts and deeds of the rich will have no power over us. they cant threaten a capital strike if we can simply maintain business without them. at the same time, we leverage our newfound labor power to democratize government itself. eventually we can form institutions of participatory democratic agencies that can act as the local demand for goods that can bargain with the labor unions acting as the economy's supply. supply and demand with no members or offices with the power or incentive to exploit another."
"And with the tyrant dead, the great coalition of friends would live in peace and harmony under free and fair democracy. Nothing bad ever happened in Yugoslavia again."
"We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content !,,"
Love these videos.
Feel like all these revolution videos have you on some kind of list now
"""democracy: the god that failed"" is an amazing book for anyone curious."
"it is post modern liberalism that permits us rich smarmy white people to continue living amongst our colonized for exploitation..

high modernism which is imperialism imposes a set standard that brings everybody up to speed"
"i will not watch this, for the sake of my mental health, but im sure this was great"
"4:40 Stalin didn't had autocratic power.. you can argue that the soviet goverment did some bad shit and they did, but saying Stalin had autocratic power because of some scheme he did is bullshit, he literally tried to renounce many times and the committee didn't let him. And theres that too, the soviet union is called >soviet< union for a reason, there's no way it could be an autocracy because it's goverment was based on soviets (russian for council), it had many tools for decentralization of power and direct democracy so the people would actively participate in it. Many factor that i can't explai led to an castellation of the soviets, reducing the democratic participation of the people but it was not an autocracy lol"
Why the reupload?
Very interesting concept to go very in depth in.
"I'd argue revolutions dont fail, on the contrary they are quite successful. Where they fail is becoming the same if not worst leaders than those that came before. They see those who dont agree with them as bourgeois or counter revolutionary. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, the French leaders during their revolution. They all claimed to want to speak for the people but only wanted power, and killed anyone who was even a spec of a threat to that power."
I would write a revolution with the Anarchists this time fight the Tankies before they backstabbed like other fake communists country
"Because they are based on the same terrible sets of ideas being attempted over and over and over again while each time expecting a different result, they are merely applied insanity."
oh shit here we go again
"Failure to gain a competing claim to monopoly of force, treason from within, apathy from without, there is a list of variables. Looking forward to your thoughts."
Rebellion is sometime just other word for replace dictator with dictator
Ideology is more important than the rules that need to be set for the regular joe who just wants to grill. When you place ideology over the rules you get terror.
I love these multi part series on geopolitical functions(like the empires one and this). Like all of these videos they really help with research for my political fantasy setting. There really is nothing else that goes into such detail and stays understandable. Thanks so much!
"Azgaar's fantasy map generator, very nice"
Love your videos 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
I feel empty when your videos are missing. Could you consider posting them more regularly?✌️
second comment
"This video is high quality and very educational, thank you!✌️"
"7:11 ""Eat the rich."" XD"
Maybe future video about why conflicts are good & peace is WTF level BS?
"Well that's an interesting video, which be useful for both real & fictional scenarios."
