       "['The expansion of Europe during the last century has been the story of\\ncrime and violence against backward peoples under the cloak of\\nprotective civilisation.\\n—CAPTAIN RICHARD MEINERTZHAGEN1\\nLIKE SO MANY OTHER AREAS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE, EAST AFRICA\\nwas opened to colonial domination with the building of railroads, the\\nsymbol of imperial achievement. By the early twentieth century\\nthousands of miles of tracks crisscrossed Africa and Asia, opening\\nthe territories to the forces of Pax Britannica. Beginning in August\\n1896, the British government financed and directed the laying of 582\\nmiles of track stretching from the coastal port of Mombasa all the\\nway to Lake Victoria and beyond. The line cut through the lush and\\nexotic landscape of the Indian Ocean coast, then through the arid,\\nlion-infested plains of Tsavo, and finally upcountry toward the Eden\\nof the interior highlands. Completed in December 1901, it was called\\nthe Uganda Railway for it linked the inland territory of Uganda to the\\noutside world. For its time the Uganda Railway stood as a remarkable\\nfeat of modern engineering.\\nBut building the railway took an enormous toll in capital and\\nmanpower. Britain spent over £6.5 million on the project and\\nimported over thirty thousand “coolies” from India, nearly a third of\\nwhom were killed or maimed by the punishing work, disease, and\\nfrequent lion attacks. Lord Salisbury’s Tory government reasoned that\\nthe railway would help to civilize East Africa by facilitating the spread\\nof Christianity and the destruction of the slave trade. It would also\\nmake it easier to counter any possible foreign invasion into Uganda,\\nwith its precious Nile headwaters. In one of the more foolish and\\nparanoid scenarios ever imagined, the British feared one of their\\nrivals, particularly Germany, would seize Uganda and dam up the\\nheadwaters of the Nile, thereby desiccating Egypt. Such an ecological\\ndisaster would, in turn, force the British to withdraw their forces from\\nthe area around the Suez; without control of the prized canal, so the\\nlogic went, Britain would also lose control of India. Such a scenario\\nwould have required the invading foreign government to mobilize\\nand import the massive equipment and manpower necessary to dam\\nnot just the White Nile but also all of the Nile’s other tributaries.\\nSomehow the railway would provide the British with quick, military\\naccess to the interior so as to frustrate any such invasion. The British\\npublic could not understand this convoluted logic. As cost overruns\\nand horrific stories of man-eating lions appeared in the British press,\\nthe Uganda Railway came to take on a new name: the “Lunatic\\nExpress.”2\\nThe building of the railroad would seem a relatively minor feat\\ncompared to the looming challenge of repaying the debt to the\\nBritish taxpayers incurred by its construction. In 1902 Sir Charles Eliot\\n—the first commissioner of the British East Africa Protectorate, as\\nKenya was called until the 1920s—surveyed the territory and its\\npeople for economic potential and found the Africans lacking in\\nnearly every respect.3\\nIn Eliot’s eyes not only were they black and\\nuncivilized, but there were just too few of them to form a nucleus of\\ncash-crop producers and future paying customers for the railroad.\\nEliot’s negative assessment was further skewed by the actions of\\nhis own government and military. The number of Africans living in\\nclose proximity to the railway would decline significantly between\\nthe time the British arrived on the scene in the 1880s and the\\ncompletion of its lunatic line. The Kikuyu were hard-hit, as they\\ntraditionally occupied the highlands of the interior that had been\\ntraversed by the rail line. Thousands of Africans died at the hands of\\nthe British who came to pacify the local population in preparation for\\neffective occupation, as formal colonial rule in Africa was called at\\nthe end of the nineteenth century. The British military launched\\npunitive expeditions that established an enduring pattern of virulent\\nracism and white violence, and their social acceptability within the\\ncolony. Francis Hall, an officer in the Imperial British East Africa\\nCompany, initiated a series of raids against the Kikuyu and remained\\nso incensed by their continued resistance that he wrote to his father,\\na British colonel, “There is only one way of improving the Wakikuyu\\n[and] that is wipe them out; I should be only too delighted to do so,\\nbut we have to depend on them for food supplies.”4 A few years\\nlater, Captain Richard Meinertzhagen, a Harrow-educated British\\narmy officer, took pride in his elimination of the Kikuyu who refused\\nto capitulate to British rule; he launched several attacks that included\\nwiping out an entire village of men, women, and elderly (the children\\nwere spared) using bayonets, rifles, machine guns, and fire.5 Part of\\nthe Kikuyu population of some five hundred thousand migrated\\nfarther into the interior and away from the British advance. They were\\nfleeing not just the armed invasion but diseases like smallpox that\\ncame with the foreign imperialists. Tragically, a series of natural\\ndisasters, including a locust plague, a prolonged drought, and an\\nepidemic of rinder-pest (a cattle disease), hit the region in the same\\nyears as British imperial pacification and took a heavy toll on the\\nKikuyu. By the time Eliot arrived on the scene to undertake his\\neconomic assessments, the losses of life and livestock, together with\\nthe migration, made parts of Kikuyuland appear to be more vacant\\nthan they truly were.6\\nIt became urgent in London to find a reliable group of people to\\ndevelop the colony’s production, make use of the railway for export,\\nand pay back the unprecedented sum of public capital that seemed\\nto have been so unwisely invested. Various options were considered.\\nThe most serious was to create in East Africa a Zionist state for\\npersecuted European Jews. Ultimately, the British colonial\\ngovernment decided to launch a campaign to attract settlers of\\nBritish stock to the colony, people who could capitalize on the\\nterritory’s agricultural potential and provide cash crops for the world\\nmarket.7 Settlers were urged to come to East Africa, where there was\\nplenty of cheap land, abundant labor, and large potential profits.\\nAdvertisements, like the following, were published in British\\nnewspapers enticing would-be settlers to pick up their stakes and\\nmove to the colony.\\nSettle in Kenya, Britain’s youngest and most attractive colony.\\nLow prices at present for fertile areas. No richer soil in the British\\nEmpire. Kenya Colony makes a practical appeal to the intending\\nsettler with some capital. Its valuable crops give high yields, due\\nto the high fertility of the soil, adequate rainfall and abundant\\nsunshine. Secure the advantage of native labor to supplement\\nyour own effort.8\\nEventually, thousands of settlers responded to the call, migrating to\\nKenya in search of their fortunes. They came determined to forge\\n“White Man’s Country.”9\\nIn many ways, the story of the pacification and effective occupation\\nof Kenya was no different from what happened all over Britain’s\\nempire at the close of the nineteenth century. Across Africa and Asia\\nentire populations were dispossessed of their land through suspect\\nbut useful alliances with illegitimate rulers, deceitful treaties, and the\\nbarrels of guns. Resistance campaigns like those in East Africa were\\nplayed out to their grim end all over the world. But bravery was no\\nmatch for the British and their Maxim gun, and imperial warfare\\nmore resembled big-game hunting than it did combat.\\nThe drive to amass African colonies at the end of the nineteenth\\ncentury represented a change in Britain’s overseas strategy, reflecting\\na shift in geopolitical tactics that had its roots in the onset of Britain’s\\neconomic decline. For decades, the British were able to dominate\\ntheir European competitors, keeping open the doors of international\\ncommerce through what has been called the “imperialism of free\\ntrade.”10 The British had not needed formal colonies in many parts of\\nAfrica, Asia, and Latin America because their global economic\\ndominance rendered those regions informal but de facto British\\nterritories; other European powers simply could not compete\\neconomically with Britain in the free market. Certainly the British did\\nmaintain formal colonial possessions, such as India and Hong Kong,\\nbut much of the world remained under Britain’s less costly and\\neconomically advantageous informal control merely through the\\nforces of the international marketplace. As the economic depression\\nof the late nineteenth century hit Britain at the same time that other\\nWestern powers—particularly Germany and the United States—were\\nsuccessfully industrializing, a serious threat to British economic\\ndominance was on the horizon. Together with changes in local\\ndomestic economies, and new alliances in European geopolitics, this\\nshift in industrialization fed an appetite for new colonies in Africa,\\nand to a lesser extent the Middle East and Asia.\\nThe Scramble for Africa, Europe’s move to partition the continent,\\nis one of the most written-about processes in imperial history.11 Until\\nthe Scramble the colonial map of Africa—with the notable exception\\nof the strategic seaports on the West and East African coasts and\\ncolonies in South Africa and Egypt—was blank. But in a few short\\ndecades, the European powers—including Britain, France, Germany,\\nPortugal, Italy, and the infamous King Leopold II of Belgium—carved\\nup the continent and divided the spoils. This began at the Congress\\nof Berlin in 1884–85, when European imperial bargaining was the first\\nstep in the establishment of nonsensical territories that divided\\nunified ethnic groups and trading networks, while forcing together\\nother groups of Africans who would have preferred to remain\\nseparate. These territories—some forty colonies and protectorates in\\nall—would later provide the basis for the modern nation-states of\\nAfrica.\\nQueen Victoria sat on Britain’s throne during much of the African\\npartition, and by the end of the nineteenth century she reigned over\\nthe most expansive empire in her country’s history. Along with her\\nnew African territories were those her imperialist negotiators picked\\nup in the Scramble in East Asia, including Malaya, parts of Borneo\\nand New Guinea, and numerous islands in the Pacific such as Fiji and\\nthe Solomons. These were added to an already impressive list of\\nformal colonies, including the prize of India and various islands in the\\nCaribbean, as well as numerous territories claiming dominion status\\nsuch as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The British Empire\\nencompassed nearly 13 million square miles or roughly 25 percent of\\nthe world’s total landmass. Queen Victoria presided over some 445\\nmillion subjects around the globe. Not included in these figures were\\nterritories that retained their informal colonial status with Britain,\\nplaces like Argentina and Brazil. Based upon the amount of British\\ncapital invested in these countries and their trading dependence on\\nBritain, these territories were British colonies in all but name.12\\nThough disparate, Britain’s far-flung empire was united by a single\\nimperial ethos, the “civilizing mission.” For the British, imperialism\\nwas not solely about exploitation; in fact, if one believed the official\\nrhetoric of the time, exploitation was hardly a factor at all in\\nmotivating Britain’s global conquests. With their superior race,\\nChristian values, and economic know-how, the British instead had a\\nduty, a moral obligation, to redeem the “backward heathens” of the\\nworld. In Africa the British were going to bring light to the Dark\\nContinent by transforming the so-called natives into progressive\\ncitizens, ready to take their place in the modern world. According to\\ntheir own line of reasoning, the British were not actually stealing\\nAfrican land or exploiting local labor but were instead self-appointed\\ntrustees for the hapless “natives,” who had not yet reached a point\\non the evolutionary scale to develop or make responsible decisions\\non their own. With proper British guidance, and tough paternalistic\\nlove, Africans could be made into progressive men and women,\\nthough it would take many decades or more likely centuries for such\\na radical transformation to take place. At first such attitudes were\\ncalled “Victorian aspirations,” although British sanctimony about so\\x02called native peoples remained relatively unchanged throughout\\nmuch of the twentieth century.13 This was cultural imperialism par\\nexcellence. This was the “White Man’s Burden.”\\nAdministering the empire was a much bigger challenge than\\nlegitimating it rhetorically, though here too a single credo prevailed.\\nIn London and throughout the empire the various levels of British\\ncolonial government were always to “trust the man on the spot.” This\\nmade great sense considering the enormity of Britain’s imperial\\nholdings; any form of micromanagement from London would have\\nbeen financially and administratively impossible, particularly under\\nBritain’s tight budget for colonial administration. The empire was\\nnever to be a burden on British taxpayers, and every colony was\\nexpected to be self-financing. This policy would place an enormous\\nburden on both local indigenous populations and colonists to\\ngenerate enough income to pay for Britain’s colonial infrastructure,\\nlike railways, roads, telegraph systems, and administrative\\npersonnel.14 It also meant there would be little funding for the\\nschools, clinics, and other social and community institutions that\\npresumably would form the backbone of Britain’s civilizing mission.\\nColonial fiscal policy also translated into enormous responsibilities\\nand challenges for the men on the spot, who were expected to rule\\nover hundreds of thousands of colonial subjects with very little\\nguidance and even smaller budgets. While there was a strong\\nconsensus for the British imperial mission, there were never any\\nhard-and-fast rules about how this mission should be carried out on\\nthe ground. Again, this may be partly explained by the fiscal\\nlimitations of British colonial governance. But there was another\\nimportant reason why these men on the ground would be given so\\nmuch latitude: they were the only colonial officials with the\\nexperience and local knowledge necessary for on-the-spot decision\\nmaking.\\nThus the most defining characteristic of British colonial\\ngovernance in Africa, and throughout most of its empire, was the\\nlooseness of its decentralized control. The empire was managed\\nlargely through a prefectural style of administration that\\nincorporated peculiarities rooted in the unique features of each\\ncolony.15 In practice administrative responsibility for the empire was\\nvested primarily in three institutions, which together made up the\\nBritish colonial government. For most of British Africa, the apex of\\nimperial governance was the Colonial Office in London.\\n16 It was\\nheaded by the secretary of state for the colonies, also known as the\\ncolonial secretary, who reported to the prime minister and who held\\nthe status of cabinet minister. Given the scope of the empire, the\\nColonial Office had a tiny staff. In 1929 there were thirty-five\\nadministrative class officials, and ten years later fewer than fifty. This\\nmade it absolutely impractical for the Colonial Office to oversee\\nanything in the various colonies but the broadest areas of policy.\\nEven then, blanket official orders issued by London were rare.\\nIntervention from the Colonial Office would be most significant at\\nthe beginning and end of empire, or in the structuring and\\ndismantling of a colonial government on the ground. In the\\nintervening years several major programs aimed at fostering\\ndevelopment in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa were broadly\\nconceived by the Colonial Office in London, though they were almost\\nentirely implemented by local colonial officials.\\nThroughout Britain’s empire there was an elite cadre of officers\\nwho functioned as the Colonial Office’s agents on the ground. It was\\nthese men who engaged daily in the trench warfare of British\\ncolonial rule. They were responsible for the day-to-day imposition of\\ncolonial authority and for adapting the broadly conceived notions of\\nBritish imperialism to their local and particular circumstances. For\\nmost Africans they were the white face of British colonial rule. In\\nKenya these colonial officials were members of the Administration, as\\nit was called. The Kenya Administration was at the bottom of the\\ncolonial governing hierarchy and was made up of provincial and\\ndistrict commissioners, as well as their subordinates, dispersed\\nthroughout the colony.17\\nThese men on the spot were not just any men. They were\\nhandpicked by the Colonial Office in targeted recruitment campaigns\\nthat openly sought future colonial rulers with backgrounds common\\nto the dominant ruling class in Britain. This was believed to be\\nabsolutely critical to the functioning of the empire. While diffuse and\\ndecentralized, colonial rule would be strengthened, it was thought,\\nby recruiting men who would conform instinctively to British imperial\\nprinciples: establishing and maintaining control over local\\npopulations, promoting fiscal self-sufficiency, and civilizing the\\nAfricans and other indigenous groups with paternalistic authority.\\nThey would not need direct day-to-day supervision because they\\nshared with their superiors in London a common ideology of\\naristocratic social superiority and thus were ipso facto equipped to\\nrule. Recruits were often the younger sons of aristocratic families, or\\nif not they shared a similar privileged pedigree rooted in the\\nprinciples of noblesse oblige. They attended public school and then\\ngenerally went on to either Oxford or Cambridge, where they were\\nsteeped in the ideals of honor, duty, and discretion. When they were\\nshipped to their remote posts, such as in Kenya, often what they\\nfound was little more than a single hut that functioned as an office,\\nlocal courthouse, and bunk. They were startlingly young, some barely\\ntwenty years of age, and had received very little formal training for\\nwhat awaited them; some former administrators from Kenya recalled\\ntheir arrival in the “bush” as analogous to being “thrown in at the\\ndeep end,”18 where they sank or swam. This rite of passage only\\ntightened their solidarity and purpose as a group. Kenya’s\\nAdministration was by all accounts a brotherhood with its own\\nunwritten code of conduct, the most important detail of which was\\nsteadfast loyalty to one another and to the Crown.19\\nBetween the Administration in the field and the Colonial Office in\\nLondon was the colonial governor and the colony’s central\\ngovernment. From London’s perspective, the governor was the most\\nimportant man on the spot. In Kenya’s case he was in charge of\\ndevising and implementing policies in his colony; he was responsible\\nfor his various members or ministers who administered departments\\nlike Native Affairs, Health and Housing, and Finance. The governor\\nalso had to cope with the colony’s Legislative Council, or LegCo, and\\nthe many vested European interests that held seats in this lawmaking\\nbody. And he had to make certain that the young colonial officers in\\nthe field were doing their jobs. The governor’s role was not to be\\nenvied. He and his central government stood foursquare in the\\nvortex of colonial pressures, simultaneously balancing and resolving\\nthe often conflicting demands of the Administration in the field and\\nthe Colonial Office back in London.\\nThe governor was ultimately an agent of the British Colonial\\nOffice who had immense discretion in running Kenya. The poor\\ncommunications linking London to its empire meant that the\\nColonial Office had little choice but to devolve a significant share of\\ndecision making to the local man in charge. Even when\\ncommunications improved significantly, the colonial secretary still\\ncontinued to operate by proxy through his governors, rather than\\ntrying to control these faraway imperial agents’ day-to-day decision\\nmaking. The effectiveness of the link between Kenya and the Colonial\\nOffice depended almost entirely on the personal relationship\\nbetween the colonial secretary and the governor, their shared ethos\\nof imperial domination, and their ability to reach consensus through\\nbargaining and negotiation. It was understood that the Colonial\\nOffice in London would not directly intervene in Kenya or elsewhere\\nin the empire, except to defuse embarrassing situations that might\\nthreaten the reputation and legitimacy of Britain’s civilizing mission.\\nEven when such problems would crop up, local colonial agents\\nwould still be given great latitude in remedying the situation.\\nWhat made Kenya unique in British Africa, along with Southern\\nRhodesia (today Zimbabwe) and South Africa, was the settlement of\\nwhite colonists who were expected to form the economic backbone\\nof the colony. Kenya’s settlers were a mixed bag, roughly falling into\\ntwo socioeconomic groups: small-scale farmers and aristocratic big\\nmen. Less affluent white immigrants largely from South Africa were\\namong the first to arrive. They brought hardened social attitudes and\\nracist views of so-called native rights that had been honed in Britain’s\\ncolonies south of the Zambezi River. Hardly ideal contributors to\\nKenya’s burgeoning economy, they were often undercapitalized.\\nEach was settled on about a thousand acres or less of cheap land.\\nTogether they quickly became a drain on the colony’s limited\\nresources, demanding infrastructure like schools, roads, and\\nhospitals, though offering little in return. In contrast, the settlers\\narriving from Britain were some of the most aristocratic immigrants\\never to populate the British Empire. Though noble by birth, many of\\nthese settlers suffered from a weakening economic position in Britain\\nwith family inheritances increasingly divided up by new generations\\nand where younger sons—as many of these men were—were often\\nexcluded from the privileges of primogeniture. By 1905 nearly three\\nthousand settlers had landed by ship in Mombasa, prepared to re\\x02create the seignorial lifestyle in the highlands of Kenya that had been\\nincreasingly difficult to maintain at home. At the coast Africans\\nloaded these lords and ladies onto railcars, along with their countless\\nbags, crates of fine china, hand-cranked gramophones, bathtubs, and\\nother necessities, for the overnight trip to their new homes\\nupcountry. When the train stopped in Nairobi, the colony’s capital\\nand hub of social and economic activity, the settlers still had to\\nbounce through miles of roadless territory—often called “miles and\\nmiles of bloody Africa,” or simply “MMBA”—on oxcarts before\\nreaching their final destinations.20\\nThey acquired estates of enormous size. Lord Delamere, the\\npopular settler leader in the early days of the colony, owned the\\nlargest, receiving title to some one hundred thousand acres in 1903\\nand acquiring another sixty thousand acres a few years later. Other\\nlandholdings, though smaller, were nonetheless impressive in size.\\nThey were all located in the fertile and temperate highlands of\\ncentral Kenya, an area which was to become the heartland of White\\nMan’s Country. These wealthy families did not come to Kenya to\\nwork, but rather to take advantage of the British government’s offer\\nof land, labor, and capital, an offer which the settlers interpreted\\nrather generously. Kenya’s new aristocrats shared Lord Delamere’s\\nambition to create a plantocracy modeled on the American South.\\nLike the colonial officers, they were united by their cultural and social\\nvalues. Many of them were old Etonians, or from similar public\\x02school backgrounds, and accustomed to a life not of working but of\\noverseeing the work of those around them. And they expected all\\nlevels of the British colonial government to support them in this\\nvision.21\\nKenya’s big men quickly established a leisurely lifestyle aspired to\\nby all Europeans in the colony. On their estates or farms or in\\nEuropean neighborhoods in Nairobi, every white settler in the colony\\nwas a lord to some extent, particularly in relationship to the African\\npopulation. They all had domestic servants, though the wealthier\\nfamilies would have dozens. Some servants would have but a single\\nresponsibility, like tending a favorite rose garden or, as in the case of\\nKaren Blixen, carrying the lady’s favorite shawl and shotgun.22 They\\nenjoyed game hunting and sport facilities, with the Nairobi racetrack\\nand polo grounds being one of the most popular European social\\nspots in town. Beyond such gentrified leisure, these privileged men\\nand women lived an absolutely hedonistic lifestyle, filled with sex,\\ndrugs, drink, and dance, followed by more of the same. In Nairobi,\\nwhere some settlers lived a full-time urban, professional life, they\\ncongregated in the Muthaiga Club, also known as the Moulin Rouge\\nof Africa. They drank champagne and pink gin for breakfast, played\\ncards, danced through the night, and generally woke up with\\nsomeone else’s spouse in the morning. At the Norfolk Hotel, better\\nknown as the House of Lords, settlers rode their horses into the Lord\\nDelamere Bar, drank heavily, and enjoyed Japanese prostitutes from\\nthe local brothel. Outside of Nairobi part of the highlands became\\nthe notorious Happy Valley, where weekend houseguests were often\\nrequired to exchange partners, cocaine and morphine were\\ndistributed at the door, and men and women compared their sexual\\nnotes when the debauchery was over. The colony’s settlers were\\nnotorious worldwide for their sexual high jinks, and the running joke\\nin Britain became, “Are you married or do you live in Kenya?”23\\nThe large landholding settlers were also a political force to be\\nreckoned with, even in the early days of the colony. Settlers\\ninfluenced colonial decision making using their political ties back in\\nLondon—many fathers, brothers, and uncles sat in the House of\\nLords—as well as because of the economic promise they represented\\nto the colony. From the start settlers made strident demands on the\\nBritish colonial government and were quite successful in gaining\\nconcessions that placed their own interests above those of the\\nAfrican population. They insisted upon and were granted low\\x02interest loans, reduced freight charges, and government subsidies for\\ntheir crops; they pushed for and won an extension of their land\\nleases in the highlands—from 99 to 999 years. Most important, they\\ngained access to the central institutions of the colonial government\\nin Nairobi when their representatives—like Delamere and later other\\nnotables like Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck and Michael Blundell—\\nbecame members of the Kenya Legislative Council. Here they had a\\ndirect role in the formulation of the colony’s laws and regulations.\\nOnce the British colonial government decided to base Kenya’s\\neconomy on the production of export commodities from the settler\\nestates, it agreed in principle to ensuring that there would be ample\\nland and labor to sustain settler production—land and labor which of\\ncourse would come from the Africans.\\nSettler self-interest was predicated on a sense of entitlement that\\nresulted not only from the shared aristocratic pedigree of many\\nBritish immigrants but also from a perception of profound racial\\nsuperiority that infused every rung of the colony’s white\\nsocioeconomic ladder.24 By virtue of their skin color, whites of all\\nclasses were the master race and therefore deserving of privilege. To\\nthe settlers there was nothing noble about the African “savage.”\\nMany believed the African to be biologically inferior, with smaller\\nbrain sizes, a limited capacity to feel pain or emotion, and even\\ndifferent nutritional needs, requiring only a bowl of maize meal, or\\nposho, to maintain their health. African men had to be controlled;\\nthey were unpredictable and sexually aggressive, threatening both\\nwhite women and the maintenance of their idealized chastity as well\\nas the racial purity of the colony’s European community.25 Virulent\\nracist ideology grew more intense over time as the so-called native\\nwas moved along the racist spectrum from stupid, inferior, lazy, and\\nchildlike to savage, barbaric, atavistic, and animal-like. This shift in\\ncharacterization would correspond closely to the Africans’ increasing\\nunwillingness to be exploited by the colonial economy, and with\\ntheir desire to reclaim land they considered to be rightfully their\\nown.\\nThough all indigenous groups were affected by British colonial rule\\nin Kenya, none experienced a transformation as intense as the\\nKikuyu. This was the ethnic group most affected by the colonial\\ngovernment’s policies of land alienation, or expropriation, and\\nEuropean settlement.26 The Kikuyu were agriculturalists who lost\\nover sixty thousand acres to the settlers, mostly in southern Kiambu,\\na highly fertile region just outside of Nairobi that would become\\nsome of the most productive European farmland in the colony. After\\nthe British military assault and natural disasters of the late nineteenth\\ncentury, many Kikuyu migrated back to their ancestral territory in the\\nhighlands, only to find Europeans living on their land. To make\\nmatters worse, the Kikuyu had for centuries relied upon territorial\\nexpansion into surrounding frontiers to alleviate population\\npressures or to defuse internal civil struggles. In particular, young\\nmen would typically set off into the forests to colonize new land,\\nestablish homesteads, marry, and raise a family. But with the coming\\nof colonial rule, the Kikuyu found themselves hemmed in on all sides:\\nto the south, east, and north were settler farms, to the west were the\\ngovernment-controlled forest reserves of the Aberdares, and to the\\nsoutheast was the expanding urban center of Nairobi.\\nThis loss of land was devastating to the Kikuyu. They were to have\\nan increasingly difficult time sustaining themselves, particularly as\\ntheir population began to recover from its earlier losses with the\\nintroduction of Western medicine and subsequent declining\\nmortality. By the 1930s the land’s productivity began to deteriorate\\nas there were simply too many Kikuyu living on it. But for the Kikuyu\\nthere was also a terrible social consequence to the British landgrab.\\nTo be a man or a woman—to move from childhood to adulthood—a\\nKikuyu had to have access to land. A man needed land to accumulate\\nthe resources necessary to pay bridewealth for a wife, or wives, who\\nwould in turn bear him children. Land and family entitled him to\\ncertain privileges within the Kikuyu patriarchy; without land a man\\nwould remain socially a boy. A woman needed land to grow crops to\\nnurture and sustain her family; without it in the eyes of the Kikuyu\\nshe was not an adult. A Kikuyu could not be a Kikuyu without land.\\nFrom the start there was a bitter emotional intensity surrounding\\nthe land issue. The Kikuyu complained angrily over the loss of their\\n“stolen land,” and there was nothing the British colonial government\\ncould do to assure them that their remaining territory was secure.\\nThere was ample reason for Kikuyu anxiety, because the very\\nfoundation of the settler community was the alienation of African\\nland. Settlers were determined to create their White Man’s Country,\\nand once land had been confiscated from the local population they\\nwere singularly focused on protecting it against any possible threat\\nof its loss. After much lobbying, the settlers extracted several\\nguarantees from the colonial government about the racially exclusive\\nand permanent nature of white settlement in the highlands, now\\ncalling it the White Highlands. Seeking to expand their numbers and\\nincrease the value of their land, they also successfully pushed for\\ncontinued immigration into the colony. After World War I the empire\\nbecame a logical place to resettle demobilized British soldiers.\\nLieutenant generals, major generals, brigadiers, colonels, majors,\\ncaptains, and their subordinates all came to Kenya. By the early\\n1920s over five hundred of these former officers and soldiers,\\ntogether with their families, were living in the colony, some on newly\\nexpropriated African land.27\\nThe promise of White Man’s Country was only partly fulfilled by\\nthe colonial government’s offer of free, or relatively free, land to the\\nsettlers. There was also the issue of labor, or more precisely cheap\\nlabor. It seems not to have mattered whether settlers were relatively\\nwell-capitalized aristocrats, poor whites from South Africa, or former\\nBritish soldiers; among all classes agricultural productivity was\\npathetically low, at least until the economic boom brought on by\\nWorld War II. Curiously, settlement policy in Kenya seemed to be\\nfocused more on numbers of immigrants than on potential economic\\nproduction.28 Many British immigrants had little or no farming\\nexperience before arriving in the colony, and many of those coming\\nfrom South Africa left because they could not make ends meet there,\\ndespite the incredible economic favoritism given to the white\\npopulation over the African majority. In Kenya there was\\nconsiderable tension between inadequate settler production on the\\none hand and, on the other, the settlers’ desire to make the colony\\ninto a white man’s enclave. It was not the inherent strength of their\\nagricultural productivity that entitled the settlers to racial privilege\\nand political power, but rather a highly interventionist colonial\\ngovernment that did everything it could to promote the settlers’\\neconomic success and, by extension, the financial viability of the\\ncolony.\\nIt grew increasingly clear that the local African population was\\ngoing to be sacrificed on behalf of settler agricultural subsidies and\\nproductivity. Labor was the one factor in the economic equation that\\nthe settlers and the colonial government could jointly manipulate,\\nand they did so ruthlessly. Rather than offering wage incentives, the\\nEuropean employers relied upon coercion by the colonial\\ngovernment to recruit African labor, which was, more often than not,\\ndrawn from the Kikuyu population then living on the edges of the\\nWhite Highlands. The government’s guarantee of cheap and\\nbountiful Kikuyu labor was based on a complex set of laws aimed at\\ncontrolling nearly every aspect of Kikuyu life. Over time, four\\nregulations, together, pushed the Kikuyu off their remaining land and\\ninto the exploitive wage economy.\\nFirst, the colonial government established African reserves, which\\nwere defined rural areas, eventually with official boundaries, much\\nlike the homelands in South Africa or the Native American reserves in\\nthe United States, where each African ethnic group in the colony was\\nexpected to live separately. The Kikuyu had their own reserves in the\\nCentral Province districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall, and Nyeri, the Maasai\\nresided mostly in the colony’s Southern Province, the Luo lived in\\nNyanza Province, and so forth. This practice of divide and rule was\\nalso a cornerstone of the colonial government’s labor policy. With\\ninsufficient land in their reserves many Africans had little choice but\\nto migrate to the European farms in search of work, and survival.29\\nBut confining the Africans was not enough to force them all into\\nthe wage economy. As an additional tactic of control, the British\\ncolonial government taxed them. The second colonial regulation\\ncalled for a hut tax and poll tax, together amounting to nearly\\ntwenty-five shillings, the equivalent of almost two months of African\\nwages at the going local rate. In response, thousands of Kikuyu\\nbegan to migrate in search of work. It was at this point that colonial\\nofficials decided to introduce the third regulation, this one to control\\nthe movement of the African workers and to keep track of their\\nemployment histories. By 1920 all African men leaving their reserves\\nwere required by law to carry a pass, or kipande, that recorded a\\nperson’s name, fingerprint, ethnic group, past employment history,\\nand current employer’s signature. The Kikuyu put the pass in a small\\nmetal container, the size of a cigarette box, and wore it around their\\nnecks. They often called it a mbugi, or goat’s bell, because, as one\\nold man recalled to me, “I was no longer a shepherd, but one of the\\nflock, going to work on the white man’s farm with my mbugi around\\nmy neck.”30 The kipande became one of the most detested symbols\\nof British colonial power, though the Africans had little recourse but\\nto carry their identity cards at all times; failure to produce it on\\ndemand brought a hefty fine, imprisonment, or both.\\nFrom the start the Africans, who were deeply resourceful and in\\nfact often much more accomplished agricultural producers than the\\nsettlers, did everything they could to negotiate their way through the\\nnew colonial economy, and to avoid being captured in the coercive\\nand exploitative labor contracts on the settler estates. In Central\\nProvince Kikuyu who had enough land adapted to the new colonial\\neconomy by increasing their own maize production and selling their\\nsurpluses in the expanding internal market. Some Kikuyu were so\\nefficient that they were able continually to undercut the price of\\nsettler-grown maize. In the early days, most Europeans in the colony\\nunderstood that African peasant production was expanding. Quick to\\nappreciate the significance of this threat, and to do everything in\\ntheir power to stymie it, the settlers again put pressure on the\\ncolonial government to intervene. Though colonial officials harbored\\ndoubts about settler productivity, the commitment to agricultural\\nproduction by European settlers had been made, and with it the\\nentrenchment of a vocal, and formidable, white minority. There was\\nno turning back. As its fourth strategy for forcing Africans into the\\nwage economy, the colonial government sought to limit African\\nagricultural production for the marketplace. Africans were forbidden\\nto grow the most profitable cash crops such as tea, coffee, and sisal\\nthough they were able to produce and sell maize freely until\\nmarketing boards were established after the Second World War that\\nrequired Africans to sell their grain at a set price. These marketing\\nboards would throw up roadblocks against African agriculture,\\nfurther forcing the indigenous population to turn to wage labor for\\nincome.31\\nThese four measures were clearly designed to subordinate African\\npeasant agriculture to that of the settlers, but this subordination did\\nnot happen overnight, nor did it always take the form preferred by\\nthe colonial government and the settler population. There was\\nanother, more feudal labor relationship that took hold in the White\\nHighlands precisely because the settlers could not capitalize\\neffectively on their embarrassment of land. Africans relentlessly and\\noften subtly sought to negotiate their way through and outwit the\\nvery system that afforded the settlers more land than they possibly\\ncould farm. A form of sharecropping called squatting evolved on\\ncash-strapped European farms throughout the colony and would\\nquickly provide the Kikuyu with access to alternative arable land\\noutside of their reserves. Shortly after the settlers’ arrival, thousands\\nof Kikuyu left for the White Highlands with their families and\\nlivestock and settled on European farms, where, in return for laboring\\nfor the European owner for about a third of the year, they could\\ncultivate a plot of land, graze their cattle and goats, and raise their\\nchildren. These Kikuyu were not wage laborers who migrated back\\nand forth between the reserves and the White Highlands; instead\\nthey left the reserves for good and set off to forge new lives and\\ncommunities on the European farms. Squatters relieved the\\npopulation pressures in the Kikuyu reserves, at least temporarily, and\\nthey also kept alive the myth that the frontier of migration was not\\nentirely closed off, but rather took on a new form with settler\\ncolonialism. There was a common fear among the settlers that\\nKikuyu squatters, particularly those living alongside the poorest\\nsettlers, would start to demand tenant rights. Still, there was no way\\nof ending the squatting phenomenon, because without these so\\x02called Kaffir farmers the settler economy would likely have collapsed\\nprior to the Second World War.32\\nThe squatters and the settlers remained, however, in an unequal\\neconomic and political relationship, with Europeans relying on the\\nsupport of the British colonial government to protect their interests\\nagainst those of the tenant farmers. Like the settlers, the squatters\\nbelieved themselves to be pioneers with long-term potential claims,\\nbut in reality their years as residents on European-owned land were\\nnumbered, and those that remained would increasingly become\\nmore punitive and less profitable. The squatters enjoyed a golden\\nage of relative freedom and thriving productivity until the end of\\nWorld War I. But in 1918 the British colonial government introduced\\nthe first of several Resident Native Labourers Ordinances. Together,\\nthese ordinances would drastically reduce squatter wealth by limiting\\nthe amount of cattle they could own and the size of their tenant\\nfarms on European land, while increasing the number of days\\nAfricans were required to work for their settler landlords. As the\\nsettlers gradually became more efficient agricultural producers, the\\nsquatters simultaneously became more and more an economic\\nanachronism. Moreover, the growth of independent squatter\\ncommunities, where the Africans collectively organized self-help\\norganizations and elders’ councils, were perceived as a threat to\\npolitical stability in the White Highlands. The settlers doggedly\\npushed for further legislation that would control the squatters, to the\\npoint of forcing all of them into the role of virtual wage laborers. For\\ntheir part, the Kikuyu living on European farms fought back by\\nillegally cultivating crops and grazing their cattle, organizing go\\x02slows, sabotaging settler machinery and livestock, and striking\\noutright. While such strikes were handily put down, squatters\\noccasionally managed to wrest small concessions from their\\nEuropean farmer landlords.33\\nThe squatters, though, lacked one critical option. They could not\\nreturn to their reserves, having given up their land claims when they\\nmigrated to the White Highlands. Indeed, many became squatters in\\nthe first place because either they did not have access to land in the\\nreserves, or that to which they did have claim was insufficient in\\nacreage or quality, or both, to support their families. When the most\\ndraconian piece of resident native legislation was introduced in 1937,\\ntransferring virtually all responsibility for the squatters to the settler\\x02controlled district councils, squatters simply had no choice but to\\nsearch for new and perhaps more radical ways to fight off this\\nencroachment on their way of life.\\nUntil World War II, there were at most eighty men in the Kenya\\nAdministration, and they had day-to-day responsibility for the\\napproximately 5 million Africans living in the colony. In practice this\\nmeant that administrators in the field needed African subordinates\\nwilling to exercise delegated power, and they found them in\\ncolonial-appointed chiefs. Throughout Britain’s African empire\\ncolonial rulers sought out collaborators who would be willing to\\nassume an authoritative role within the colonial government,\\nbeneath the provincial and district administrators to be sure, but\\ndecidedly above the rest of a colony’s African subjects. This was the\\nbasis of indirect rule, a way of administering the empire on the cheap\\nby co-opting local African leaders, using them to enforce discipline\\nand control over local populations, and in return providing them with\\ngenerous material rewards. Such a system was predicated upon the\\nEuropean stereotype of traditional African political systems, which\\nalways placed the chief at the top of the hierarchy; the chief, in turn,\\nhad the fundamental role of maintaining “tribal order.”34\\nBut the Kikuyu did not have chiefs. Prior to colonialism, they were\\na stateless society, governed by councils of elders and lineage heads.\\nIn Kikuyu districts these new chiefs were a phenomenon of colonial\\nrule. They were created by the colonial government and thus wholly\\nillegitimate in the eyes of ordinary Kikuyu people. By accepting\\nBritish authority, the chiefs were granted a monopoly of power in the\\nAfrican districts and given a great deal of autonomy to exercise it.\\nTheir primary jobs were labor recruitment, or labor encouragement,\\nas the colonial government called it, and tax collection—two colonial\\ndemands that the ordinary Kikuyu attempted to avoid, or at least\\nnegotiate. But the chiefs had sufficient incentives to enforce these\\nmeasures with impunity. If they did not perform, they would be\\ndismissed and replaced, and sacking would mean the loss of their\\nbogus chiefly title and all of the political power and socioeconomic\\nprivilege that went along with it. So the chiefs ruled with an iron fist,\\nearning a reputation for both corruption and oppression. They\\ntraveled with their own semiofficial entourages of “tribal retainers,”\\nmany of whom did the dirty work of collecting taxes and procuring\\nlabor. This labor was not only for the agricultural support of the\\nsettlers but also for the colonial government. In the early days of\\nKenya the colonial government was the largest—and rumored to be\\nthe worst—single employer of African labor, which it put to work\\nbuilding the colony’s infrastructure of roads, secondary railways, and\\nthe like.\\nThe introduction of chiefs brought with it a bitter internal conflict\\nwithin the Kikuyu community, a conflict that only intensified over\\ntime. This is not to say that there was no internal differentiation\\namong the Kikuyu prior to colonial rule. The Kikuyu certainly did not\\nlive in a pre-colonial socialist utopia without class divisions. The\\ncompetitive environment that spawned the chiefs was a direct result\\nof the intense internal competition for resources and wealth that\\npeaked at the time of colonization. The chiefs merely capitalized on\\nthe opportunities that came with the power they derived from\\ncolonial rule. Catapulted into the new colonial hierarchy by their self\\x02interest, they proceeded to do away with local Kikuyu competition by\\nforcing the entrepreneurial masses out of the peasant economy and\\ng p p y\\ninto the colonial wage market. To add insult to injury, the chiefs were\\nrewarded for their loyalty to the colony and the Crown with larger\\nand more fertile parcels of land in the reserves, superior seed,\\nlicenses to conduct internal trade, and access to local cheap labor, all\\ningredients for success in the peasant agricultural sector. Throughout\\nits rule the colonial government would accelerate and manipulate\\nsocioeconomic differentiation in Kikuyu society. While the Kikuyu\\ncould easily be described as the most exploited group of Africans in\\nKenya, at the same time a tiny minority of them would become\\namong the greatest beneficiaries of colonial rule.\\nThe hypocrisies of British colonialism did not escape the Kikuyu. By\\nthe early 1920s a small group of progressive and educated young\\nmen formed a political organization called the Kikuyu Central\\nAssociation, or KCA, to challenge the colonial establishment.\\nPolitically savvy and knowledgeable about the intricacies of the\\nBritish colonial government, these men pursued their complaints\\nthrough the limited channels of petition and constitutional redress.\\nThey took their demands on matters of land and forced labor from\\nthe local field level of the Kenya Administration to the colony’s\\ncentral government in Nairobi and ultimately to the final arbiter, the\\nColonial Office in London. Working through formal channels for\\nseveral years, the KCA would leap into the spotlight when it waged a\\ncultural battle against the British colonial government over the issue\\nof female circumcision.\\nLeading the KCA as its general secretary in the late 1920s was a\\nyoung Kikuyu by the name of Johnstone Kenyatta. Like the KCA’s\\nother members, Kenyatta was relatively conservative and upwardly\\nmobile, and was seeking to capitalize on the opportunities made\\navailable by the new colonial system, though denied to him because\\nhe was not an appointed chief. Importantly, Kenyatta and his fellow\\nKCA members were products of a missionary education. The\\nmissionaries had a leading role in Britain’s civilizing mission in Kenya,\\nas they did throughout most of the empire. Missionaries were\\ndetermined to convert the Africans not just to Christianity but to an\\nentire Western way of life. They competed with one another for\\nAfrican souls, with each denomination carving out its own spheres of\\ninfluence throughout Britain’s colonies. In the Kikuyu reserves the\\nPresbyterians, the Anglicans, the Methodists, and the Catholics\\ndominated the Christian scene, establishing mission stations—which\\nincluded churches, schools, and medical clinics—condemning the\\nheathenism of Kikuyu religious and cultural practices, and preaching\\nthe values of Christianity, commerce, and civilization. For the colonial\\ngovernment, missionaries offered civilization on the cheap. To the\\ndegree that any education or welfare services were provided to the\\nlocal African population, they were delivered largely by missionaries.\\nOf course, the Africans would have to pay school fees and health\\x02care costs; in fact, to earn the right to buy these services the Kikuyu,\\nlike all other colonial subjects, had to renounce their own religion\\nand convert to Christianity.35\\nWhen Protestant mission societies launched an attack on the\\nKikuyu custom of female circumcision, the KCA responded vigorously\\nby defending their cultural practice. The issue exploded in the 1920s\\nafter several missionaries banned the practice for their converts. In\\nresponse to missionary pressure, colonial officials in Nairobi altered\\ntheir typical hands-off approach toward African customs and urged\\nthe Local Native Councils in the Kikuyu districts to restrict and\\nregulate female circumcision. By 1929, thousands of Kikuyu were\\nprotesting and leaving the established churches to form their own\\nindependent churches and schools, which would permit the practice\\nto continue. This single cultural issue mobilized the Kikuyu peasants\\nfor the first time and, in so doing, provided the KCA with a mass\\npolitical base.36\\nThe repeated, reasoned demands that were issued by Kikuyu\\npoliticians on the subject of circumcision brought home the realities\\nof Britain’s civilizing mission in Kenya. The colonial government\\nresponded to the KCA with unequivocal hostility, labeling it a\\ndangerous and subversive organization that was unrepresentative of\\nthe Kikuyu majority. This reaction was a reflection of both British\\nimperial self-interest and a twisted sense of colonial paternalism,\\nparticularly on the part of the Administration in the Kikuyu reserves.\\nDespite the fact that these men on the spot, the young members of\\nBritain’s ruling elite who considered themselves to be the protectors\\nof “their natives,” were watching Kikuyu country rapidly deteriorate\\naround them, many continued to believe they had come to Africa to\\noversee a slow, organic change from savagery to civilization. They\\nwere trustees who acted in the best interests of the African, who\\nafter all had to be protected from himself. Though this paternalistic\\nnotion permeated all ranks of the colonial government, it was\\nparticularly strong in the African reserves, where the members of the\\nAdministration re-created their own public-school drama, taking the\\nrole of the tough but loving headmaster and casting the Africans in\\nthat of the young and artless innocents.\\nKikuyu political leaders had no role in this script. They were a rival\\nleadership, outside of the colonial hierarchy, and, according to\\ncolonial officials, betrayed the dangers inherent in educating Africans\\ntoo quickly. Their demands for responsibilities for which they were\\nassumed to be ill-equipped rendered them, in the eyes of the\\ncolonial government, detribalized or semi-educated agitators. In the\\nwake of the female-circumcision controversy, KCA members were no\\nlonger simply agitators but also atavistic, anti-Western, and anti\\x02Christian agitators. It became the duty of the British colonial\\ngovernment to protect the hapless Africans from these\\ntroublemakers.\\nIn hindsight it is difficult to assess how much British colonial\\nofficials actually believed their own delusional rhetoric. They could\\nnot fail to see the destructive impact of British colonialism on the\\nKikuyu population, though colonial logic always seemed able to find\\nfault with presumed African inefficiencies, or customs, or inherent\\nracial inferiority rather than the injustices of colonial rule. Such\\nmyopia freed colonial officials from responsibility for the collapsing\\nKikuyu society. At the outbreak of the Second World War the British\\ncolonial government outlawed the KCA, on the pretext that Kikuyu\\npolitical leaders were secretly contacting fascists in the nearby Italian\\ncolony of Ethiopia, in preparation for an armed invasion. As Kenya\\ny p p p y\\nreadied itself for war, colonial officials believed that with the\\nelimination of the self-interested Kikuyu politicians and with even\\nmore paternalistic British guidance, the Kikuyu could aspire to\\nsomeday achieving the lofty standards of British civilization.\\nThe Second World War brought vast changes to Kenya, changes that\\nexposed the inequities of British colonial rule, galvanized Kikuyu\\ndiscontent, and channeled it into a mass peasant movement that\\nwould be called Mau Mau. The war converted the settlers into a\\npowerful economic force in Kenya. The economic boom resulting\\nfrom wartime demand at long last transformed their agricultural\\nproduction into a profitable venture, and profits would continue for\\nthe next twenty years. The colonial government continued to\\nintervene to satisfy the settlers’ wartime labor needs, conscripting\\nAfricans onto European farms. Meanwhile, the Administration in the\\nAfrican districts, and particularly the Kikuyu reserves, followed the\\ndirectives of their superiors in Nairobi and London and pushed the\\nlocal African farmer population to produce as much as possible for\\nthe war effort, a complete about-face from the explicit\\ndiscouragement of peasant production in previous decades. Under\\nincreasing pressure, the Kikuyu were left with little choice but to\\nabandon such traditional farming practices as crop rotation and\\nresting land with fallow periods, and instead intensely cultivate every\\navailable parcel in their reserves.\\nThe settlers were poised to take advantage of a notable change\\nin Kenya’s relationship with the British government. A tighter\\neconomic bond between the colony and London persisted after the\\nwar as Britain looked to its empire to help the nation through its\\nreconstruction. A series of Colonial Development and Welfare Acts\\nwere passed that provided unprecedented sums of capital to the\\ncolonies. Misleadingly named, these infusions of cash were not\\nintended to strengthen colonial trusteeship of the Africans, but\\nrather had the clear objective of lifting Britain’s economy out of its\\npostwar crisis. These capital investments were targeted largely at the\\nsettler economy in Kenya, in response to its recent expansion of scale\\nand profitability. By ramping up settler agricultural production, the\\nBritish government planned to purchase European-produced\\nproducts like coffee, tea, and pyrethrum through local government\\x02controlled marketing boards, then resell the same products on the\\nworld market at higher prices. Since many of these goods were\\ngoing to the United States, the British government would in\\nexchange receive dollars that were critical to paying off its wartime\\ndebt to the Americans. For their part, the settlers benefited from\\nunprecedented government support and financial intervention\\ncalculated to ensure the expansion and increased profitability of their\\nestates.37\\nIn spite of their hard work, after 1945 the Kikuyu way of life\\nsuffered a serious decline, particularly in relationship to the settlers.\\nAfter decades of intensive farming, the reserves were on the brink of\\nan agricultural crisis, and the Kikuyu were divided between the rich\\nbut tiny chiefly minority and the majority, who had endured not just\\nexploitation but loss of land and status under British rule. Making\\nmatters worse, the colonial government was convinced that the so\\x02called traditional and primitive Kikuyu agricultural practices of land\\x02mining, continuous cultivation, and overstocking of cattle and goats\\nwere the real reasons for the reduced soil fertility and accelerated\\nerosion. In an effort to mitigate the ill effects of these practices,\\ncolonial authorities introduced a series of postwar development\\nprojects aimed at averting what appeared to be an incipient\\necological disaster.38\\nIn practical terms this meant that active steps were taken to\\nprevent the Kikuyu from producing for local markets. Restricted from\\ncapitalizing on the expanding colonial economy, the Kikuyu were left\\nto subsistence production in the reserves and forced to work free of\\ncharge on a variety of soil conservation programs. This proved to be\\nthe most egregious of all colonial programs of coerced labor, with\\nwomen shouldering the bulk of the strenuous and unpleasant work\\n—such as the creation of hundreds of miles of communal terraces to\\ncounteract soil erosion—since most of the men had become more\\nand more dependent upon wage labor. The root of the problem in\\nthe reserves was, of course, the simple fact that too many Kikuyu\\nwere living on too little land. The only solution was an expansion of\\nthe boundaries of the Kikuyu reserves or a change in policy to allow\\nthe Africans to own land in the exclusive White Highlands. Neither\\npolicy was considered at this time.39\\nThe Kikuyu soldiers who returned from war would galvanize the\\ngrowing popular discontent. As part of the Allied forces, the British\\ngovernment marshaled troops from around its empire. The Kikuyu,\\nlike other British subjects, joined the British army and were shipped\\noff to fight in the Middle East and the India-Burma theaters of war.40\\nAfter the Allied victory, they returned home with a new global\\nawareness of nationalist movements like that in India, as well as a\\ngenuine belief that they had fought for the principles of self\\x02determination against the forces of fascism. In Kenya Kikuyu veterans\\nfound many of their British counterparts receiving demobilization\\nsupport from the colonial government in the form of land, low\\x02interest loans, and job creation programs. Ex-servicemen from Britain\\nconstituted another wave of immigrants to Kenya, coming to the\\ncolony through soldier settlement schemes much like those after the\\nFirst World War. Kikuyu veterans expected a homecoming different\\nfrom the status quo, perhaps even one bringing improvements to\\ntheir daily lives commensurate with their contributions to the war\\neffort. Dismayingly, they found that their fortunes, and those of their\\nfellow Kikuyu, not only had remained unchanged but were steadily\\nworsening.\\nThe basis for a popular Kikuyu movement extended well beyond\\nthe boundaries of the reserves. In the White Highlands increased\\nmechanization introduced by European settlers forced thousands of\\nsquatters off their farms, and those that remained were forced to\\nwork harder and for longer hours. The closing of the squatter frontier\\ncreated an agitated group of homeless and property-less people in a\\nland they considered to be their own. Some went back to the\\nreserves, though they received a less than warm reception from\\ndistant family members who were already struggling. Popular\\ndiscontent was also taking hold in depressed urban areas,\\nparticularly Nairobi, to which many of the dispossessed squatters\\nand impoverished peasants from the reserves migrated in search of\\nwork. The African residential areas in the city quickly became\\novercrowded, unemployment escalated, and inflation skyrocketed.\\nThe so-called informal economy—including hawking, beer brewing,\\nand prostitution—offered many urban residents their only hope of\\nsurvival. It was hardly surprising that the Kikuyu poor, already\\ndisaffected by their loss of land and condemned to an alien urban\\nexistence, sought to redress their grievances against both the\\nEuropean and African agents of colonialism.\\nIn spite of abundant Kikuyu frustration, there still did not exist the\\nmeans by which to mobilize. Kikuyu politicians from the KCA, as well\\nas the nascent trade union movement, had been forced underground\\nduring the war, only to reemerge in 1944 with the formation of the\\nKenya African Union, or KAU. Three years later Kenyatta—now calling\\nhimself Jomo Kenyatta—returned to Kenya after a sixteen-year stay\\nin Britain, where he studied at the London School of Economics,\\ncosponsored a Pan African Congress with Kwame Nkrumah, and\\nwrote his controversial book, Facing Mount Kenya, which was a\\nhighly polemical defense of the cultural practices of the Kikuyu, and\\nof their ability to speak for themselves.41 Kenyatta’s return electrified\\nthe colony, making it apparent that he was not only the chosen\\nleader of the Kikuyu people but also the popular protagonist for the\\nentire indigenous population in Kenya.\\nHowever, it was neither Kenyatta nor KAU who discovered a\\nmeans for mobilizing the masses, but rather a group of several\\nthousand Kikuyu squatters who had been forced to leave the White\\nHighlands and resettle in an area called Olenguruone. Threatened by\\nthe colonial government with yet another eviction, sometime around\\n1943 the Olenguruone residents radicalized the traditional Kikuyu\\npractice of oathing. Typically, Kikuyu men had taken an oath to forge\\nsolidarity during times of war or internal crises; the oath would\\nmorally bind men together in the face of great challenges. But at\\nOlenguruone the oath was transformed by the changing political\\ncircumstances of British colonialism, and local Kikuyu leaders\\nadministered it not only to men but to women and children as well.\\nThis oath united the Kikuyu at Olenguruone in a collective effort to\\nfight the injustices of British rule.42\\nMass oathing spread rapidly as African politicians quickly\\nrecognized its potential for organizing, though it was largely limited\\nto the Kikuyu population. Initial grassroots support for oathing\\nlargely came from members of the Kikuyu independent schools and\\nchurches, which had been formed in the wake of the earlier female\\x02circumcision crisis. By 1950 the scale of the oathing campaign made\\nthe movement’s detection unavoidable, and the colony’s African\\nAffairs Department noted that “secret meetings were being held in\\nwhich an illegal oath, accompanied by appropriately horrid ritual,\\nwas being administered to initiates binding them to treat all\\nGovernment servants as enemies, to disobey Government orders and\\neventually to evict all Europeans from the country.”43\\nThe movement that would be popularized as Mau Mau44 was\\nquickly seen by colonial officials as a unified force. In reality,\\nhowever, its leadership, pulled from KAU and other groups, came to\\nbe divided over several issues, most notably the methods by which\\nAfrican grievances should be addressed. By 1950 the young militants\\n—many of them drawn from the ranks of the ex-soldier community\\n—began splitting from the moderate political elite of KAU. These\\nradicals assumed control over the oathing campaigns, many of which\\nwere now being imposed by force. They introduced several different\\noaths, each representing a deeper pledge of loyalty to the\\nmovement and a deeper commitment to violent action. The militant\\nwing was able successfully to link Kikuyu urban and rural discontent.\\nPreferring violent means, they began to replace earlier constitutional\\nmethods of reproach, such as those advocated by Kenyatta and his\\nmoderate compatriots, with calls for active, armed resistance. In spite\\nof the August 1950 government ban on Mau Mau, the pace of\\nviolence quickened not only in the White Highlands, where the\\nremaining squatters, frustrated at every turn, saw hope in the\\nmilitants’ demands for land and freedom, but also in Nairobi, where\\nthe conditions of the urban poor steadily eroded, and in the Kikuyu\\nreserves, where members of the chiefly community were already\\nbeing murdered by Mau Mau adherents.45\\nOathing ceremonies, so crucial to the solidarity of ordinary\\nKikuyu, could number well over one hundred participants. Mau Mau\\ninitiates often would enter into a liminal state by passing through an\\narch of banana leaves and stripping naked, in effect shedding their\\nformer status in the community and preparing themselves for their\\nsymbolic rebirth as Mau Mau adherents. With some variation, an\\noath administrator would direct the slaughtering of a goat and then\\nlead the initiates in a ritual. He would sometimes begin by asking\\nthem, “[Do you] agree to become a Kikuyu, a full Kikuyu, free from\\nblemish?”46 The initiates would answer in the affirmative, and they\\nwould then bite and ingest a piece of the goat meat. The oath\\nadministrator would go on to inquire if the candidate wanted to\\nknow the “secret” of the Kikuyu people, and again the initiates would\\nanswer in the affirmative and receive instruction in the history of the\\nKikuyu people and Mau Mau’s goals of land and freedom.47 Various\\nvows were then repeated, followed by the refrain “may this oath kill\\nme.” Two of the most common pledges were “If I know of any enemy\\nof our organization and fail to kill him, may this oath kill me,” and “If\\nI reveal this oath to any European, may this oath kill me.”48 Following\\neach vow, the initiates would again bite and ingest pieces of meat\\nfrom the slaughtered goat.\\nThe oath not only created a new status for the Kikuyu as reborn\\nmembers of Mau Mau but also served as a moral contract. A genuine\\nfear of reprisal infused most of the oath takers, regardless of whether\\nthey were willing participants in the ceremony or not. Forced oathing\\ndid not make the pledge less binding, and in fact the bind of the\\noath often prevented them—even under torture or threat of death—\\nfrom betraying the movement. Just as a Kikuyu one hundred years\\nearlier believed he could not elude the power of an oath, so many\\nMau Mau adherents believed in the repercussions of breaking their\\npledge. In an interview one former Mau Mau adherent insisted, “It\\nwas a very strong oath, in the Kikuyu belief, just like during the old\\ndays when the Kikuyu elders, after having slaughtered a goat, they\\nused to hit the ground with their sticks while uttering the words, ‘He\\nwho divulges information about the kiama [council], may he fall\\ndown like this!’”49 In effect, the Kikuyu believed that if an oath taker\\nviolated his or her pledge, then loyalty to Mau Mau would be\\nbroken. If someone confessed having taken the oath, that person\\nwould suffer the wrath of the Kikuyu creator god, Ngai. His\\npunishment would come in the form of injury—or, more likely, death.\\nSuch beliefs render research into oathing an enormous challenge.\\nTo this day, most former Mau Mau adherents believe in the power of\\nthe oath and the fatal consequences of divulging its secrets. For\\nexample, while traveling in the area of Mathira near the foot of\\nMount Kenya, I asked Lucy Mugwe, an elderly Kikuyu woman whom I\\nhad been interviewing for some time, what had happened to one of\\nher neighbors who was missing. She replied, “Oh, she was walking\\nback up the hill carrying water [which was roughly a fifteen-gallon\\ncontainer strapped around her forehead and swung over her back]\\nwhen her cow walked in her path and knocked her over. She died not\\nlong thereafter.” Lucy then leaned over and in a hushed voice\\nreminded me, “But you know it was to be expected…that woman\\nconfessed the oath years ago.”50 Only after considerable time living\\nin the field did I begin to explore the issue of oathing with former\\nMau Mau adherents, and even then I only scratched the surface of its\\nhistory and meaning.\\nThe British colonial government estimated that the first Mau Mau\\noath, or the oath of unity, was administered to nearly 90 percent of\\nthe 1.5 million Kikuyu people.51 As the movement progressed, the\\nMau Mau leadership devised seven different oaths, with each\\nsuccessive level representing greater commitment to the movement.\\nAccompanying each new oath was a new ritual that incorporated the\\ndrinking of animal and even human blood, and the biting or eating\\nof various animal parts. In one account of the fourth oath, a Kikuyu\\nwas bound together with his fellow initiates using a goat intestine,\\nwas cut on his arms by the oath administrator, then compelled to lick\\nblood from the fresh wounds of his fellow oath takers. According to\\nthe initiate, “After taking the blood, one felt how a woman feels\\ntowards her harvest of maize or beans [e.g., protective]. That was\\nhow someone who had taken [this] oath felt about his land. He could\\ndo anything to protect it, even if it meant death.”52 The seventh and\\nfinal oath was called the batuni, or killing oath. It would become\\nmore widespread after Kenya’s governor declared a State of\\nEmergency in the colony, and was administered only to those who\\nwere prepared to fight in the forests.\\nIndoctrination into the Mau Mau movement drew upon this\\nadaptation of traditional Kikuyu oathing for the new explosive\\ncircumstances of the postwar period. Whereas the colonial\\ngovernment, and certainly the local settlers, viewed oathing as\\nbarbaric mumbo jumbo and further evidence of the backwardness\\nand savagery of the Kikuyu, the practice had logic and purpose. It\\nwas the rational response of a rural people seeking to understand\\nthe enormous socioeconomic and political changes taking place\\naround them while attempting to respond collectively to new and\\nunjust realities.\\nOn the eve of the Mau Mau war, there were hundreds of\\nthousands of Kikuyu who had taken an oath of unity, pledging their\\nlives for Mau Mau and its demand for land and freedom. When the\\nEuropean settlers and the colonial government learned of the\\nmovement, land and freedom were clearly understood as demands\\nfor the return of disputed land and an end to British colonialism. But\\nfor those Kikuyu who pledged themselves to Mau Mau, the\\nmeanings of land and freedom were less defined and much more\\ncomplex than merely tossing off the British yoke and reclaiming the\\nland of their ancestors. In part, the specific meaning of Mau Mau\\ntended to reflect the age, gender, and birthplace of the oath taker.\\nFor some of them, land and freedom meant a rejection of the\\ncolonial-appointed chiefs and their policies of self\\x02aggrandizement.53 For many men in the younger generation, it was a\\ndemand for a return of the frontier where they could once again earn\\ntheir adulthood, often with the help of an elder Kikuyu patron.54 For\\nsome Kikuyu women, land and freedom represented an end to the\\nbackbreaking terracing projects and other forms of forced communal\\nlabor.55 For others, the slogan represented a future hope of finding\\nfarms in the overcrowded reserves that were large enough to feed\\ntheir children.56 It was as much the ambiguity as the specificity of\\nMau Mau’s demand for land and freedom that made it so appealing\\nto the Kikuyu masses and such a powerful and difficult movement for\\nthe British to suppress.\\nBy 1950 Kenya was on the verge of one of the bloodiest and most\\nprotracted wars of decolonization fought in Britain’s twentieth\\x02century empire. Mau Mau had enormous grassroots support, and it\\nwas clearly directed at both the white and black faces of British\\ncolonial rule, notably the settlers and the colonial-appointed chiefs.\\nFor their part, the settlers reacted with predictable hysteria and with\\ndemands for a draconian response on the part of the colonial\\ngovernment. Though the settlers were by no means a unified\\nideological force—there certainly existed a spectrum of European\\nopinion in the colony on all issues—they quickly coalesced around\\nthe issue of Mau Mau. Whereas for years the proverbial “conservative\\ntail wagged the moderate dog”57 in Kenyan settler politics, with the\\nonset of Mau Mau settler conservatism and overt racism would\\nharden, and local European opinion would collectively move farther\\nand farther to the right.\\nAlongside the settlers stood the other target of Mau Mau hatred,\\nthe colonial-appointed chiefs and their followers who in the\\nupcoming war would be called loyalists. These men became\\nenormously wealthy and powerful at the expense of their fellow\\nKikuyu. Some even earned the status of senior chief, overseeing vast\\nportions of the Kikuyu reserves, with all the inherent potential for\\nself-aggrandizement. For the Kikuyu masses, senior chiefs like the\\nsoon-to-be-famous Waruhiu represented everything that was\\ncorrupt about Britain’s civilizing mission. The backbone of loyalist\\nsupport during Mau Mau would come from these men, along with\\nthe lesser chiefs and headmen, and their coteries. Importantly,\\nloyalist would come to have a very specific meaning for the colonial\\ngovernment and for those who considered themselves loyalists, of\\nwhich there would ultimately be several thousand. Quite simply,\\nloyalist was a term for any Kikuyu who would actively fight on the\\nside of the British government against the Mau Mau movement and\\nwho in return would be granted privileges that would far outweigh\\nanything that previously had been granted to the chiefly community\\nduring the years leading up to the war.\\nFor Mau Mau followers, those who betrayed their movement had\\nto be eliminated. This included not just the loyalists but also the\\nsmall minority of devout Kikuyu Christians who were neither Mau\\nMau nor loyalist, and who suffered persecutions from both opposing\\nfactions. The local Christian missionaries would fight endlessly with\\nthe colonial government to expand the official definition of loyalism,\\nclaiming that their Christian flock comprised the most loyal and\\nWestern-leaning Kikuyu in the colony. They would have very limited\\nsuccess. Throughout the war these missionaries would play a pivotal\\nrole, as many witnessed the atrocities that would unfold in the\\ndetention camps and barbed-wire villages. The degree to which they\\nwould intervene against—and in some cases abet—colonial violence\\nwould be a reflection of their own self-interests and their loyalty to\\nthe colonial government.\\nOverseeing the unfolding Mau Mau drama was Kenya’s governor,\\nSir Philip Mitchell, and the colonial secretary in London, Oliver\\nLyttelton. Mitchell was a short, pudgy, and by all accounts rather\\nunlikable man who, on paper, appeared to be the governor best\\nsuited to take on the job in Kenya in late 1944. He was at the end of\\na long and distinguished career in Britain’s colonial service, which\\npresumably made him the ideal candidate. He was, though, staunchly\\ndetermined to retire with a spotless record, a goal which took on\\nnew meaning when his colony became the new jewel of the British\\nEmpire after Britain’s loss of India in 1947. When Mau Mau began to\\nemerge as a real force in 1950, Mitchell downplayed its significance\\nand scope to the Colonial Office, as well as the escalating violence\\np g\\nand disorder.58 Anything less would have been an admission of his\\nfailure to govern. Right up to his retirement in June 1952, he sent\\nmemo after memo to London inaccurately reporting the peace and\\nprogress of his colony. In reality, violence was already reaching\\nserious proportions, with Mau Mau hamstringing settler cattle,\\nburning crops, and murdering Kikuyu loyal to the British. Had he\\nalerted Colonial Secretary Lyttelton, London would surely have\\nintervened, and several senior officials on the spot would have been\\nheld accountable and their careers tarnished. Remarkably, Mitchell\\nsuccessfully managed to retire with honor, though his charade would\\nsoon be unveiled. During the long summer of 1952, as Kenya awaited\\nits new governor, the situation continued to deteriorate. It was now\\nclear to those on the spot that Mau Mau was preparing to launch an\\nanticolonial and civil rebellion, though few at the time foresaw the\\nlevel of destruction that lay over the horizon.\\n']"

       "['The expansion of Europe during the last century has been the story of\\ncrime and violence against backward peoples under the cloak of\\nprotective civilisation.\\n—CAPTAIN RICHARD MEINERTZHAGEN1\\nLIKE SO MANY OTHER AREAS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE, EAST AFRICA\\nwas opened to colonial domination with the building of railroads, the\\nsymbol of imperial achievement. By the early twentieth century\\nthousands of miles of tracks crisscrossed Africa and Asia, opening\\nthe territories to the forces of Pax Britannica. Beginning in August\\n1896, the British government financed and directed the laying of 582\\nmiles of track stretching from the coastal port of Mombasa all the\\nway to Lake Victoria and beyond. The line cut through the lush and\\nexotic landscape of the Indian Ocean coast, then through the arid,\\nlion-infested plains of Tsavo, and finally upcountry toward the Eden\\nof the interior highlands. Completed in December 1901, it was called\\nthe Uganda Railway for it linked the inland territory of Uganda to the\\noutside world. For its time the Uganda Railway stood as a remarkable\\nfeat of modern engineering.\\nBut building the railway took an enormous toll in capital and\\nmanpower. Britain spent over £6.5 million on the project and\\nimported over thirty thousand “coolies” from India, nearly a third of\\nwhom were killed or maimed by the punishing work, disease, and\\nfrequent lion attacks. Lord Salisbury’s Tory government reasoned that\\nthe railway would help to civilize East Africa by facilitating the spread\\nof Christianity and the destruction of the slave trade. It would also\\nmake it easier to counter any possible foreign invasion into Uganda,\\nwith its precious Nile headwaters. In one of the more foolish and',\n",
       " 'with its precious Nile headwaters. In one of the more foolish and\\nparanoid scenarios ever imagined, the British feared one of their\\nrivals, particularly Germany, would seize Uganda and dam up the\\nheadwaters of the Nile, thereby desiccating Egypt. Such an ecological\\ndisaster would, in turn, force the British to withdraw their forces from\\nthe area around the Suez; without control of the prized canal, so the\\nlogic went, Britain would also lose control of India. Such a scenario\\nwould have required the invading foreign government to mobilize\\nand import the massive equipment and manpower necessary to dam\\nnot just the White Nile but also all of the Nile’s other tributaries.\\nSomehow the railway would provide the British with quick, military\\naccess to the interior so as to frustrate any such invasion. The British\\npublic could not understand this convoluted logic. As cost overruns\\nand horrific stories of man-eating lions appeared in the British press,\\nthe Uganda Railway came to take on a new name: the “Lunatic\\nExpress.”2\\nThe building of the railroad would seem a relatively minor feat\\ncompared to the looming challenge of repaying the debt to the\\nBritish taxpayers incurred by its construction. In 1902 Sir Charles Eliot\\n—the first commissioner of the British East Africa Protectorate, as\\nKenya was called until the 1920s—surveyed the territory and its\\npeople for economic potential and found the Africans lacking in\\nnearly every respect.3\\nIn Eliot’s eyes not only were they black and\\nuncivilized, but there were just too few of them to form a nucleus of\\ncash-crop producers and future paying customers for the railroad.\\nEliot’s negative assessment was further skewed by the actions of\\nhis own government and military.

The number of Africans living in\\nclose proximity to the railway would decline significantly between\\nthe time the British arrived on the scene in the 1880s and the\\ncompletion of its lunatic line. The Kikuyu were hard-hit, as they\\ntraditionally occupied the highlands of the interior that had been\\ntraversed by the rail line. Thousands of Africans died at the hands of\\nthe British who came to pacify the local population in preparation for\\neffective occupation, as formal colonial rule in Africa was called at\\nthe end of the nineteenth century. The British military launched\\npunitive expeditions that established an enduring pattern of virulent\\nracism and white violence, and their social acceptability within the\\ncolony. Francis Hall, an officer in the Imperial British East Africa\\nCompany, initiated a series of raids against the Kikuyu and remained\\nso incensed by their continued resistance that he wrote to his father,\\na British colonel, “There is only one way of improving the Wakikuyu\\n[and] that is wipe them out; I should be only too delighted to do so,\\nbut we have to depend on them for food supplies.”4 A few years\\nlater, Captain Richard Meinertzhagen, a Harrow-educated British\\narmy officer, took pride in his elimination of the Kikuyu who refused\\nto capitulate to British rule; he launched several attacks that included\\nwiping out an entire village of men, women, and elderly (the children\\nwere spared) using bayonets, rifles, machine guns, and fire.5 Part of\\nthe Kikuyu population of some five hundred thousand migrated\\nfarther into the interior and away from the British advance. They were\\nfleeing not just the armed invasion but diseases like smallpox that',\n",

Tragically, a series of natural\\ndisasters, including a locust plague, a prolonged drought, and an\\nepidemic of rinder-pest (a cattle disease), hit the region in the same\\nyears as British imperial pacification and took a heavy toll on the\\nKikuyu. By the time Eliot arrived on the scene to undertake his\\neconomic assessments, the losses of life and livestock, together with\\nthe migration, made parts of Kikuyuland appear to be more vacant\\nthan they truly were.6\\nIt became urgent in London to find a reliable group of people to\\ndevelop the colony’s production, make use of the railway for export,\\nand pay back the unprecedented sum of public capital that seemed\\nto have been so unwisely invested. Various options were considered.\\nThe most serious was to create in East Africa a Zionist state for\\npersecuted European Jews. Ultimately, the British colonial\\ngovernment decided to launch a campaign to attract settlers of\\nBritish stock to the colony, people who could capitalize on the\\nterritory’s agricultural potential and provide cash crops for the world\\nmarket.7 Settlers were urged to come to East Africa, where there was\\nplenty of cheap land, abundant labor, and large potential profits.\\nAdvertisements, like the following, were published in British\\nnewspapers enticing would-be settlers to pick up their stakes and\\nmove to the colony.\\nSettle in Kenya, Britain’s youngest and most attractive colony.\\nLow prices at present for fertile areas.

They came determined to forge\\n“White Man’s Country.”9\\nIn many ways, the story of the pacification and effective occupation\\nof Kenya was no different from what happened all over Britain’s\\nempire at the close of the nineteenth century. Across Africa and Asia\\nentire populations were dispossessed of their land through suspect\\nbut useful alliances with illegitimate rulers, deceitful treaties, and the\\nbarrels of guns. Resistance campaigns like those in East Africa were\\nplayed out to their grim end all over the world. But bravery was no\\nmatch for the British and their Maxim gun, and imperial warfare\\nmore resembled big-game hunting than it did combat.\\nThe drive to amass African colonies at the end of the nineteenth\\ncentury represented a change in Britain’s overseas strategy, reflecting\\na shift in geopolitical tactics that had its roots in the onset of Britain’s\\neconomic decline. For decades, the British were able to dominate\\ntheir European competitors, keeping open the doors of international\\ncommerce through what has been called the “imperialism of free\\ntrade.”10 The British had not needed formal colonies in many parts of\\nAfrica, Asia, and Latin America because their global economic\\ndominance rendered those regions informal but de facto British\\nterritories; other European powers simply could not compete\\neconomically with Britain in the free market. Certainly the British did\\nmaintain formal colonial possessions, such as India and Hong Kong,\\nbut much of the world remained under Britain’s less costly and\\neconomically advantageous informal control merely through the\\nforces of the international marketplace.

As the economic depression\\nof the late nineteenth century hit Britain at the same time that other\\nWestern powers—particularly Germany and the United States—were\\nsuccessfully industrializing, a serious threat to British economic\\ndominance was on the horizon. Together with changes in local\\ndomestic economies, and new alliances in European geopolitics, this\\nshift in industrialization fed an appetite for new colonies in Africa,\\nand to a lesser extent the Middle East and Asia.\\nThe Scramble for Africa, Europe’s move to partition the continent,\\nis one of the most written-about processes in imperial history.11 Until\\nthe Scramble the colonial map of Africa—with the notable exception\\nof the strategic seaports on the West and East African coasts and\\ncolonies in South Africa and Egypt—was blank. But in a few short\\ndecades, the European powers—including Britain, France, Germany,\\nPortugal, Italy, and the infamous King Leopold II of Belgium—carved\\nup the continent and divided the spoils. This began at the Congress\\nof Berlin in 1884–85, when European imperial bargaining was the first\\nstep in the establishment of nonsensical territories that divided\\nunified ethnic groups and trading networks, while forcing together\\nother groups of Africans who would have preferred to remain\\nseparate. These territories—some forty colonies and protectorates in\\nall—would later provide the basis for the modern nation-states of\\nAfrica.\\nQueen Victoria sat on Britain’s throne during much of the African\\npartition, and by the end of the nineteenth century she reigned over\\nthe most expansive empire in her country’s history. Along with her\\nnew African territories were those her imperialist negotiators picked\\nup in the Scramble in East Asia, including Malaya, parts of Borneo',\n",
       " 'up in the Scramble in East Asia, including Malaya, parts of Borneo\\nand New Guinea, and numerous islands in the Pacific such as Fiji and\\nthe Solomons. These were added to an already impressive list of\\nformal colonies, including the prize of India and various islands in the\\nCaribbean, as well as numerous territories claiming dominion status\\nsuch as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The British Empire\\nencompassed nearly 13 million square miles or roughly 25 percent of\\nthe world’s total landmass. Queen Victoria presided over some 445\\nmillion subjects around the globe. Not included in these figures were\\nterritories that retained their informal colonial status with Britain,\\nplaces like Argentina and Brazil. Based upon the amount of British\\ncapital invested in these countries and their trading dependence on\\nBritain, these territories were British colonies in all but name.12\\nThough disparate, Britain’s far-flung empire was united by a single\\nimperial ethos, the “civilizing mission.” For the British, imperialism\\nwas not solely about exploitation; in fact, if one believed the official\\nrhetoric of the time, exploitation was hardly a factor at all in\\nmotivating Britain’s global conquests. With their superior race,\\nChristian values, and economic know-how, the British instead had a\\nduty, a moral obligation, to redeem the “backward heathens” of the\\nworld. In Africa the British were going to bring light to the Dark\\nContinent by transforming the so-called natives into progressive\\ncitizens, ready to take their place in the modern world. According to\\ntheir own line of reasoning, the British were not actually stealing\\nAfrican land or exploiting local labor but were instead self-appointed\\ntrustees for the hapless “natives,” who had not yet reached a point',\n",
       " 'on the evolutionary scale to develop or make responsible decisions\\non their own. With proper British guidance, and tough paternalistic\\nlove, Africans could be made into progressive men and women,\\nthough it would take many decades or more likely centuries for such\\na radical transformation to take place. At first such attitudes were\\ncalled “Victorian aspirations,” although British sanctimony about so\\x02called native peoples remained relatively unchanged throughout\\nmuch of the twentieth century.13 This was cultural imperialism par\\nexcellence. This was the “White Man’s Burden.”\\nAdministering the empire was a much bigger challenge than\\nlegitimating it rhetorically, though here too a single credo prevailed.\\nIn London and throughout the empire the various levels of British\\ncolonial government were always to “trust the man on the spot.” This\\nmade great sense considering the enormity of Britain’s imperial\\nholdings; any form of micromanagement from London would have\\nbeen financially and administratively impossible, particularly under\\nBritain’s tight budget for colonial administration. The empire was\\nnever to be a burden on British taxpayers, and every colony was\\nexpected to be self-financing. This policy would place an enormous\\nburden on both local indigenous populations and colonists to\\ngenerate enough income to pay for Britain’s colonial infrastructure,\\nlike railways, roads, telegraph systems, and administrative\\npersonnel.14 It also meant there would be little funding for the\\nschools, clinics, and other social and community institutions that\\npresumably would form the backbone of Britain’s civilizing mission.\\nColonial fiscal policy also translated into enormous responsibilities\\nand challenges for the men on the spot, who were expected to rule\\nover hundreds of thousands of colonial subjects with very little\\nguidance and even smaller budgets. While there was a strong',\n",

While there was a strong\\nconsensus for the British imperial mission, there were never any\\nhard-and-fast rules about how this mission should be carried out on\\nthe ground. Again, this may be partly explained by the fiscal\\nlimitations of British colonial governance. But there was another\\nimportant reason why these men on the ground would be given so\\nmuch latitude: they were the only colonial officials with the\\nexperience and local knowledge necessary for on-the-spot decision\\nmaking.\\nThus the most defining characteristic of British colonial\\ngovernance in Africa, and throughout most of its empire, was the\\nlooseness of its decentralized control. The empire was managed\\nlargely through a prefectural style of administration that\\nincorporated peculiarities rooted in the unique features of each\\ncolony.15 In practice administrative responsibility for the empire was\\nvested primarily in three institutions, which together made up the\\nBritish colonial government. For most of British Africa, the apex of\\nimperial governance was the Colonial Office in London.\\n16 It was\\nheaded by the secretary of state for the colonies, also known as the\\ncolonial secretary, who reported to the prime minister and who held\\nthe status of cabinet minister. Given the scope of the empire, the\\nColonial Office had a tiny staff. In 1929 there were thirty-five\\nadministrative class officials, and ten years later fewer than fifty. This\\nmade it absolutely impractical for the Colonial Office to oversee\\nanything in the various colonies but the broadest areas of policy.\\nEven then, blanket official orders issued by London were rare.\\nIntervention from the Colonial Office would be most significant at\\nthe beginning and end of empire, or in the structuring and\\ndismantling of a colonial government on the ground.

It was\\nthese men who engaged daily in the trench warfare of British\\ncolonial rule. They were responsible for the day-to-day imposition of\\ncolonial authority and for adapting the broadly conceived notions of\\nBritish imperialism to their local and particular circumstances. For\\nmost Africans they were the white face of British colonial rule. In\\nKenya these colonial officials were members of the Administration, as\\nit was called.

Even when\\ncommunications improved significantly, the colonial secretary still\\ncontinued to operate by proxy through his governors, rather than\\ntrying to control these faraway imperial agents’ day-to-day decision\\nmaking.

But for the Kikuyu\\nthere was also a terrible social consequence to the British landgrab.\\nTo be a man or a woman—to move from childhood to adulthood—a\\nKikuyu had to have access to land.

A Kikuyu could not be a Kikuyu without land.\\nFrom the start there was a bitter emotional intensity surrounding\\nthe land issue. The Kikuyu complained angrily over the loss of their\\n“stolen land,” and there was nothing the British colonial government\\ncould do to assure them that their remaining territory was secure.\\nThere was ample reason for Kikuyu anxiety, because the very\\nfoundation of the settler community was the alienation of African\\nland.

It seems not to have mattered whether settlers were relatively\\nwell-capitalized aristocrats, poor whites from South Africa, or former\\nBritish soldiers; among all classes agricultural productivity was\\npathetically low, at least until the economic boom brought on by\\nWorld War II. Curiously, settlement policy in Kenya seemed to be\\nfocused more on numbers of immigrants than on potential economic\\nproduction.28 Many British immigrants had little or no farming\\nexperience before arriving in the colony, and many of those coming\\nfrom South Africa left because they could not make ends meet there,\\ndespite the incredible economic favoritism given to the white\\npopulation over the African majority.

The government’s guarantee of cheap and\\nbountiful Kikuyu labor was based on a complex set of laws aimed at\\ncontrolling nearly every aspect of Kikuyu life.

The Kikuyu had their own reserves in the\\nCentral Province districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall, and Nyeri, the Maasai\\nresided mostly in the colony’s Southern Province, the Luo lived in\\nNyanza Province, and so forth.

With\\ninsufficient land in their reserves many Africans had little choice but\\nto migrate to the European farms in search of work, and survival.29\\nBut confining the Africans was not enough to force them all into\\nthe wage economy. As an additional tactic of control, the British\\ncolonial government taxed them. The second colonial regulation\\ncalled for a hut tax and poll tax, together amounting to nearly\\ntwenty-five shillings, the equivalent of almost two months of African\\nwages at the going local rate. In response, thousands of Kikuyu\\nbegan to migrate in search of work. It was at this point that colonial\\nofficials decided to introduce the third regulation, this one to control\\nthe movement of the African workers and to keep track of their\\nemployment histories. By 1920 all African men leaving their reserves\\nwere required by law to carry a pass, or kipande, that recorded a\\nperson’s name, fingerprint, ethnic group, past employment history,\\nand current employer’s signature. The Kikuyu put the pass in a small\\nmetal container, the size of a cigarette box, and wore it around their\\nnecks. They often called it a mbugi, or goat’s bell, because, as one\\nold man recalled to me, “I was no longer a shepherd, but one of the\\nflock, going to work on the white man’s farm with my mbugi around\\nmy neck.”30 The kipande became one of the most detested symbols\\nof British colonial power, though the Africans had little recourse but\\nto carry their identity cards at all times; failure to produce it on\\ndemand brought a hefty fine, imprisonment, or both.',\n",

In Central\\nProvince Kikuyu who had enough land adapted to the new colonial\\neconomy by increasing their own maize production and selling their\\nsurpluses in the expanding internal market. Some Kikuyu were so\\nefficient that they were able continually to undercut the price of\\nsettler-grown maize. In the early days, most Europeans in the colony\\nunderstood that African peasant production was expanding. Quick to\\nappreciate the significance of this threat, and to do everything in\\ntheir power to stymie it, the settlers again put pressure on the\\ncolonial government to intervene. Though colonial officials harbored\\ndoubts about settler productivity, the commitment to agricultural\\nproduction by European settlers had been made, and with it the\\nentrenchment of a vocal, and formidable, white minority. There was\\nno turning back. As its fourth strategy for forcing Africans into the\\nwage economy, the colonial government sought to limit African\\nagricultural production for the marketplace. Africans were forbidden\\nto grow the most profitable cash crops such as tea, coffee, and sisal\\nthough they were able to produce and sell maize freely until\\nmarketing boards were established after the Second World War that\\nrequired Africans to sell their grain at a set price. These marketing\\nboards would throw up roadblocks against African agriculture,\\nfurther forcing the indigenous population to turn to wage labor for\\nincome.31\\nThese four measures were clearly designed to subordinate African\\npeasant agriculture to that of the settlers, but this subordination did',\n",

Africans relentlessly and\\noften subtly sought to negotiate their way through and outwit the\\nvery system that afforded the settlers more land than they possibly\\ncould farm. A form of sharecropping called squatting evolved on\\ncash-strapped European farms throughout the colony and would\\nquickly provide the Kikuyu with access to alternative arable land\\noutside of their reserves. Shortly after the settlers’ arrival, thousands\\nof Kikuyu left for the White Highlands with their families and\\nlivestock and settled on European farms, where, in return for laboring\\nfor the European owner for about a third of the year, they could\\ncultivate a plot of land, graze their cattle and goats, and raise their\\nchildren. These Kikuyu were not wage laborers who migrated back\\nand forth between the reserves and the White Highlands; instead\\nthey left the reserves for good and set off to forge new lives and\\ncommunities on the European farms. Squatters relieved the\\npopulation pressures in the Kikuyu reserves, at least temporarily, and\\nthey also kept alive the myth that the frontier of migration was not\\nentirely closed off, but rather took on a new form with settler\\ncolonialism. There was a common fear among the settlers that\\nKikuyu squatters, particularly those living alongside the poorest\\nsettlers, would start to demand tenant rights.

The closing of the squatter frontier\\ncreated an agitated group of homeless and property-less people in a\\nland they considered to be their own. Some went back to the\\nreserves, though they received a less than warm reception from\\ndistant family members who were already struggling. Popular\\ndiscontent was also taking hold in depressed urban areas,\\nparticularly Nairobi, to which many of the dispossessed squatters\\nand impoverished peasants from the reserves migrated in search of\\nwork. The African residential areas in the city quickly became\\novercrowded, unemployment escalated, and inflation skyrocketed.',\n",
       " 'overcrowded, unemployment escalated, and inflation skyrocketed.\\nThe so-called informal economy—including hawking, beer brewing,\\nand prostitution—offered many urban residents their only hope of\\nsurvival. It was hardly surprising that the Kikuyu poor, already\\ndisaffected by their loss of land and condemned to an alien urban\\nexistence, sought to redress their grievances against both the\\nEuropean and African agents of colonialism.\\nIn spite of abundant Kikuyu frustration, there still did not exist the\\nmeans by which to mobilize. Kikuyu politicians from the KCA, as well\\nas the nascent trade union movement, had been forced underground\\nduring the war, only to reemerge in 1944 with the formation of the\\nKenya African Union, or KAU. Three years later Kenyatta—now calling\\nhimself Jomo Kenyatta—returned to Kenya after a sixteen-year stay\\nin Britain, where he studied at the London School of Economics,\\ncosponsored a Pan African Congress with Kwame Nkrumah, and\\nwrote his controversial book, Facing Mount Kenya, which was a\\nhighly polemical defense of the cultural practices of the Kikuyu, and\\nof their ability to speak for themselves.41 Kenyatta’s return electrified\\nthe colony, making it apparent that he was not only the chosen\\nleader of the Kikuyu people but also the popular protagonist for the\\nentire indigenous population in Kenya.\\nHowever, it was neither Kenyatta nor KAU who discovered a\\nmeans for mobilizing the masses, but rather a group of several\\nthousand Kikuyu squatters who had been forced to leave the White\\nHighlands and resettle in an area called Olenguruone. Threatened by\\nthe colonial government with yet another eviction, sometime around',\n",
       " 'the colonial government with yet another eviction, sometime around\\n1943 the Olenguruone residents radicalized the traditional Kikuyu\\npractice of oathing. Typically, Kikuyu men had taken an oath to forge\\nsolidarity during times of war or internal crises; the oath would\\nmorally bind men together in the face of great challenges. But at\\nOlenguruone the oath was transformed by the changing political\\ncircumstances of British colonialism, and local Kikuyu leaders\\nadministered it not only to men but to women and children as well.\\nThis oath united the Kikuyu at Olenguruone in a collective effort to\\nfight the injustices of British rule.42\\nMass oathing spread rapidly as African politicians quickly\\nrecognized its potential for organizing, though it was largely limited\\nto the Kikuyu population. Initial grassroots support for oathing\\nlargely came from members of the Kikuyu independent schools and\\nchurches, which had been formed in the wake of the earlier female\\x02circumcision crisis. By 1950 the scale of the oathing campaign made\\nthe movement’s detection unavoidable, and the colony’s African\\nAffairs Department noted that “secret meetings were being held in\\nwhich an illegal oath, accompanied by appropriately horrid ritual,\\nwas being administered to initiates binding them to treat all\\nGovernment servants as enemies, to disobey Government orders and\\neventually to evict all Europeans from the country.”43\\nThe movement that would be popularized as Mau Mau44 was\\nquickly seen by colonial officials as a unified force. In reality,\\nhowever, its leadership, pulled from KAU and other groups, came to\\nbe divided over several issues, most notably the methods by which\\nAfrican grievances should be addressed. By 1950 the young militants\\n—many of them drawn from the ranks of the ex-soldier community',\n",
       " '—many of them drawn from the ranks of the ex-soldier community\\n—began splitting from the moderate political elite of KAU. These\\nradicals assumed control over the oathing campaigns, many of which\\nwere now being imposed by force. They introduced several different\\noaths, each representing a deeper pledge of loyalty to the\\nmovement and a deeper commitment to violent action. The militant\\nwing was able successfully to link Kikuyu urban and rural discontent.\\nPreferring violent means, they began to replace earlier constitutional\\nmethods of reproach, such as those advocated by Kenyatta and his\\nmoderate compatriots, with calls for active, armed resistance. In spite\\nof the August 1950 government ban on Mau Mau, the pace of\\nviolence quickened not only in the White Highlands, where the\\nremaining squatters, frustrated at every turn, saw hope in the\\nmilitants’ demands for land and freedom, but also in Nairobi, where\\nthe conditions of the urban poor steadily eroded, and in the Kikuyu\\nreserves, where members of the chiefly community were already\\nbeing murdered by Mau Mau adherents.45\\nOathing ceremonies, so crucial to the solidarity of ordinary\\nKikuyu, could number well over one hundred participants. Mau Mau\\ninitiates often would enter into a liminal state by passing through an\\narch of banana leaves and stripping naked, in effect shedding their\\nformer status in the community and preparing themselves for their\\nsymbolic rebirth as Mau Mau adherents. With some variation, an\\noath administrator would direct the slaughtering of a goat and then\\nlead the initiates in a ritual. He would sometimes begin by asking\\nthem, “[Do you] agree to become a Kikuyu, a full Kikuyu, free from\\nblemish?”46 The initiates would answer in the affirmative, and they',\n",
       " 'blemish?”46 The initiates would answer in the affirmative, and they\\nwould then bite and ingest a piece of the goat meat. The oath\\nadministrator would go on to inquire if the candidate wanted to\\nknow the “secret” of the Kikuyu people, and again the initiates would\\nanswer in the affirmative and receive instruction in the history of the\\nKikuyu people and Mau Mau’s goals of land and freedom.47 Various\\nvows were then repeated, followed by the refrain “may this oath kill\\nme.” Two of the most common pledges were “If I know of any enemy\\nof our organization and fail to kill him, may this oath kill me,” and “If\\nI reveal this oath to any European, may this oath kill me.”48 Following\\neach vow, the initiates would again bite and ingest pieces of meat\\nfrom the slaughtered goat.\\nThe oath not only created a new status for the Kikuyu as reborn\\nmembers of Mau Mau but also served as a moral contract. A genuine\\nfear of reprisal infused most of the oath takers, regardless of whether\\nthey were willing participants in the ceremony or not. Forced oathing\\ndid not make the pledge less binding, and in fact the bind of the\\noath often prevented them—even under torture or threat of death—\\nfrom betraying the movement. Just as a Kikuyu one hundred years\\nearlier believed he could not elude the power of an oath, so many\\nMau Mau adherents believed in the repercussions of breaking their\\npledge. In an interview one former Mau Mau adherent insisted, “It\\nwas a very strong oath, in the Kikuyu belief, just like during the old\\ndays when the Kikuyu elders, after having slaughtered a goat, they',\n",
       " 'days when the Kikuyu elders, after having slaughtered a goat, they\\nused to hit the ground with their sticks while uttering the words, ‘He\\nwho divulges information about the kiama [council], may he fall\\ndown like this!’”49 In effect, the Kikuyu believed that if an oath taker\\nviolated his or her pledge, then loyalty to Mau Mau would be\\nbroken. If someone confessed having taken the oath, that person\\nwould suffer the wrath of the Kikuyu creator god, Ngai. His\\npunishment would come in the form of injury—or, more likely, death.\\nSuch beliefs render research into oathing an enormous challenge.\\nTo this day, most former Mau Mau adherents believe in the power of\\nthe oath and the fatal consequences of divulging its secrets. For\\nexample, while traveling in the area of Mathira near the foot of\\nMount Kenya, I asked Lucy Mugwe, an elderly Kikuyu woman whom I\\nhad been interviewing for some time, what had happened to one of\\nher neighbors who was missing. She replied, “Oh, she was walking\\nback up the hill carrying water [which was roughly a fifteen-gallon\\ncontainer strapped around her forehead and swung over her back]\\nwhen her cow walked in her path and knocked her over. She died not\\nlong thereafter.” Lucy then leaned over and in a hushed voice\\nreminded me, “But you know it was to be expected…that woman\\nconfessed the oath years ago.”50 Only after considerable time living\\nin the field did I begin to explore the issue of oathing with former\\nMau Mau adherents, and even then I only scratched the surface of its\\nhistory and meaning.\\nThe British colonial government estimated that the first Mau Mau',\n",
       " 'history and meaning.\\nThe British colonial government estimated that the first Mau Mau\\noath, or the oath of unity, was administered to nearly 90 percent of\\nthe 1.5 million Kikuyu people.51 As the movement progressed, the\\nMau Mau leadership devised seven different oaths, with each\\nsuccessive level representing greater commitment to the movement.\\nAccompanying each new oath was a new ritual that incorporated the\\ndrinking of animal and even human blood, and the biting or eating\\nof various animal parts. In one account of the fourth oath, a Kikuyu\\nwas bound together with his fellow initiates using a goat intestine,\\nwas cut on his arms by the oath administrator, then compelled to lick\\nblood from the fresh wounds of his fellow oath takers. According to\\nthe initiate, “After taking the blood, one felt how a woman feels\\ntowards her harvest of maize or beans [e.g., protective]. That was\\nhow someone who had taken [this] oath felt about his land. He could\\ndo anything to protect it, even if it meant death.”52 The seventh and\\nfinal oath was called the batuni, or killing oath. It would become\\nmore widespread after Kenya’s governor declared a State of\\nEmergency in the colony, and was administered only to those who\\nwere prepared to fight in the forests.\\nIndoctrination into the Mau Mau movement drew upon this\\nadaptation of traditional Kikuyu oathing for the new explosive\\ncircumstances of the postwar period. Whereas the colonial\\ngovernment, and certainly the local settlers, viewed oathing as\\nbarbaric mumbo jumbo and further evidence of the backwardness\\nand savagery of the Kikuyu, the practice had logic and purpose. It\\nwas the rational response of a rural people seeking to understand\\nthe enormous socioeconomic and political changes taking place',\n",
       " 'the enormous socioeconomic and political changes taking place\\naround them while attempting to respond collectively to new and\\nunjust realities.\\nOn the eve of the Mau Mau war, there were hundreds of\\nthousands of Kikuyu who had taken an oath of unity, pledging their\\nlives for Mau Mau and its demand for land and freedom. When the\\nEuropean settlers and the colonial government learned of the\\nmovement, land and freedom were clearly understood as demands\\nfor the return of disputed land and an end to British colonialism. But\\nfor those Kikuyu who pledged themselves to Mau Mau, the\\nmeanings of land and freedom were less defined and much more\\ncomplex than merely tossing off the British yoke and reclaiming the\\nland of their ancestors. In part, the specific meaning of Mau Mau\\ntended to reflect the age, gender, and birthplace of the oath taker.\\nFor some of them, land and freedom meant a rejection of the\\ncolonial-appointed chiefs and their policies of self\\x02aggrandizement.53 For many men in the younger generation, it was a\\ndemand for a return of the frontier where they could once again earn\\ntheir adulthood, often with the help of an elder Kikuyu patron.54 For\\nsome Kikuyu women, land and freedom represented an end to the\\nbackbreaking terracing projects and other forms of forced communal\\nlabor.55 For others, the slogan represented a future hope of finding\\nfarms in the overcrowded reserves that were large enough to feed\\ntheir children.56 It was as much the ambiguity as the specificity of\\nMau Mau’s demand for land and freedom that made it so appealing\\nto the Kikuyu masses and such a powerful and difficult movement for\\nthe British to suppress.\\nBy 1950 Kenya was on the verge of one of the bloodiest and most',\n",
       " 'By 1950 Kenya was on the verge of one of the bloodiest and most\\nprotracted wars of decolonization fought in Britain’s twentieth\\x02century empire. Mau Mau had enormous grassroots support, and it\\nwas clearly directed at both the white and black faces of British\\ncolonial rule, notably the settlers and the colonial-appointed chiefs.\\nFor their part, the settlers reacted with predictable hysteria and with\\ndemands for a draconian response on the part of the colonial\\ngovernment. Though the settlers were by no means a unified\\nideological force—there certainly existed a spectrum of European\\nopinion in the colony on all issues—they quickly coalesced around\\nthe issue of Mau Mau. Whereas for years the proverbial “conservative\\ntail wagged the moderate dog”57 in Kenyan settler politics, with the\\nonset of Mau Mau settler conservatism and overt racism would\\nharden, and local European opinion would collectively move farther\\nand farther to the right.\\nAlongside the settlers stood the other target of Mau Mau hatred,\\nthe colonial-appointed chiefs and their followers who in the\\nupcoming war would be called loyalists. These men became\\nenormously wealthy and powerful at the expense of their fellow\\nKikuyu. Some even earned the status of senior chief, overseeing vast\\nportions of the Kikuyu reserves, with all the inherent potential for\\nself-aggrandizement. For the Kikuyu masses, senior chiefs like the\\nsoon-to-be-famous Waruhiu represented everything that was\\ncorrupt about Britain’s civilizing mission. The backbone of loyalist\\nsupport during Mau Mau would come from these men, along with\\nthe lesser chiefs and headmen, and their coteries. Importantly,\\nloyalist would come to have a very specific meaning for the colonial\\ngovernment and for those who considered themselves loyalists, of',\n",
       " 'government and for those who considered themselves loyalists, of\\nwhich there would ultimately be several thousand. Quite simply,\\nloyalist was a term for any Kikuyu who would actively fight on the\\nside of the British government against the Mau Mau movement and\\nwho in return would be granted privileges that would far outweigh\\nanything that previously had been granted to the chiefly community\\nduring the years leading up to the war.\\nFor Mau Mau followers, those who betrayed their movement had\\nto be eliminated. This included not just the loyalists but also the\\nsmall minority of devout Kikuyu Christians who were neither Mau\\nMau nor loyalist, and who suffered persecutions from both opposing\\nfactions. The local Christian missionaries would fight endlessly with\\nthe colonial government to expand the official definition of loyalism,\\nclaiming that their Christian flock comprised the most loyal and\\nWestern-leaning Kikuyu in the colony. They would have very limited\\nsuccess. Throughout the war these missionaries would play a pivotal\\nrole, as many witnessed the atrocities that would unfold in the\\ndetention camps and barbed-wire villages. The degree to which they\\nwould intervene against—and in some cases abet—colonial violence\\nwould be a reflection of their own self-interests and their loyalty to\\nthe colonial government.\\nOverseeing the unfolding Mau Mau drama was Kenya’s governor,\\nSir Philip Mitchell, and the colonial secretary in London, Oliver\\nLyttelton. Mitchell was a short, pudgy, and by all accounts rather\\nunlikable man who, on paper, appeared to be the governor best\\nsuited to take on the job in Kenya in late 1944.

He was, though, staunchly\\ndetermined to retire with a spotless record, a goal which took on\\nnew meaning when his colony became the new jewel of the British\\nEmpire after Britain’s loss of India in 1947. When Mau Mau began to\\nemerge as a real force in 1950, Mitchell downplayed its significance\\nand scope to the Colonial Office, as well as the escalating violence\\np g\\nand disorder.58 Anything less would have been an admission of his\\nfailure to govern. Right up to his retirement in June 1952, he sent\\nmemo after memo to London inaccurately reporting the peace and\\nprogress of his colony. In reality, violence was already reaching\\nserious proportions, with Mau Mau hamstringing settler cattle,\\nburning crops, and murdering Kikuyu loyal to the British. Had he\\nalerted Colonial Secretary Lyttelton, London would surely have\\nintervened, and several senior officials on the spot would have been\\nheld accountable and their careers tarnished. Remarkably, Mitchell\\nsuccessfully managed to retire with honor, though his charade would\\nsoon be unveiled. During the long summer of 1952, as Kenya awaited\\nits new governor, the situation continued to deteriorate. It was now\\nclear to those on the spot that Mau Mau was preparing to launch an\\nanticolonial and civil rebellion, though few at the time foresaw the\\nlevel of destruction that lay over the horizon.']"

       "The British introduced a wage labor system in Kenya through a series of policies and regulations. These policies included:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Confinement of Africans to reserves.** The British colonial government confined Africans to reserves, which were areas of land set aside for African use. This policy was designed to limit African access to land and resources, and to make them more dependent on wage labor.\n",
       "* **Taxation.** The British colonial government imposed taxes on Africans, which they had to pay in cash. This policy forced Africans to find wage labor in order to earn the money to pay their taxes.\n",
       "* **Pass laws.** The British colonial government required Africans to carry passes, which were documents that recorded their identity and employment status. These passes were used to control the movement of Africans and to prevent them from leaving the reserves without permission.\n",
       "* **Labor recruitment.** The British colonial government recruited Africans to work on European farms and plantations. This recruitment was often done through coercion, and Africans were often forced to work in dangerous and unhealthy conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "The introduction of the wage labor system had a devastating impact on the lives of Africans in Kenya. It led to the breakdown of traditional African society, as people were forced to leave their homes and families to work for low wages. It also led to the impoverishment of many Africans, as they were unable to earn enough money to support themselves and their families.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wage labor system also led to a great deal of resentment among Africans. They felt that they were being exploited by the British, and that they were not being given a fair share of the profits from their labor. This resentment eventually led to the Mau Mau Uprising, a rebellion against British rule."
